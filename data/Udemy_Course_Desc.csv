https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/,Java Programming Masterclass updated to Java 17,Learn Java In This Course And Become a Computer Programmer. Obtain valuable Core Java Skills And Java Certification,"December 24, 2022 UPDATE - SECOND PART OF THE MASSIVE NEW UPDATE FOR JAVA 17 IS LIVE TODAY.  Read below to find out why you want to be learning Java 17 and not another version. This course has been constantly updated since it originally came out in 2016.  All updates are included free.  Buy the course once and get all future updates free. You’ve just stumbled upon the most complete, in-depth  Java programming course online . With over 742,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and seventy four thousand reviews ( with   tens of thousands of those 5-star)  to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need.  Whether you want to: - build the skills you need to get your first Java programming job - move to a more senior software developer position - pass the oracle java certification exam - or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps (desktop or web based) quickly. ...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this,  and more.   Why would you choose to learn Java? The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there.  It's in the hundreds.  Why would you choose the Java language? The number one reason is its popularity.  According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is  in the top 3 most popular languages worldwide in 2022.   Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language. The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use.  Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today and continually updated by the owners, Oracle, over 30 years later. Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want  and which course will give you those skills? This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer.  By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer.  Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course. Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course.  She didn't even complete the course! "" Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course.   I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated.  Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing.   With gratitude,  Laura"" The course is a whopping 100 hours long.   Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it.   Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all? Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer. Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java. The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total).  The Java Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through. For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces.  JavaFX (which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on.  So you could skip that section entirely.  But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you.   And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish. If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position. What version of Java should you learn? Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but  that's not the case   with Java. Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java.  Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support.  Other versions have long-term support, for many years. You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time. A company using Java technology (big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support.  They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates. Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support (LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there. As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that's Java 17. The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.   BOTTOM LINE: You will learn the RIGHT VERSION of JAVA in this course!  Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers. Will this course give me core java skills? Yes, it will.  Core Java is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies. Why should you take this course? It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course. There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students.  It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners. What makes this course a bestseller?  Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep.  Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content. This course assumes  no previous coding experience  and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program.  You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time. Here’s just some of what you’ll learn (It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course) All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps. How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales) How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.   IntelliJ  has both a  FREE  and PAID version, and you can use either in this course. (Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course) Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE (Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks.  That's what this course will help you to achieve. “AP-what?” Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs. This truly is Java for complete beginners.  By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs.  Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique  challenge feature . Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a  real-world scenario. You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on. This is a proven way to help you  understand  Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works.  As your instructor, I have close to   40 years of experience  as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 22 years  (I’ve taught students younger than that) . Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too! It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results... See what your fellow students have to say: ""This course was a guiding light in my ""Becoming a developer"" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to ""Tim Buchalka"" my Master."" - Sina Jz ""I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes. I wrote a code and showed it to a programmer, and he was shocked, he told me that I'm more than ready to start a programming career."" - Amirreza Moeini ""I am taking this class in conjunction with a Java 101 college class. I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of a college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said ""go make a program that does *whatever*"" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked."" - Stacy Harris It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results,  and you can be too … This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects,  Is the course updated? As mentioned above, yes. It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released  every day , meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge. A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning an older version of Java can be counterproductive - you could be learning the ""old way"" of doing things, rather than using current technology. Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.   That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at  no extra charge . Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak).  And when I say updated, I also mean enhanced.  With the recently released Java 17 update, a lot of the content has changed to actually include features included in Java 17.  This is not just a ""rebadged"" update - the content is updated with new features of Java.  Videos are actually re-recorded, etc. With this complete Java Masterclass, you will always have updated, relevant content. What if I have questions? As if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer  full support , answering any questions you have  7 days a week  (whereas many instructors answer just once per week,  or not at all ).  This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With my hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.

It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.      However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.     And how can you do that?    Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)    Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture    The Solution     Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.     Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out    Mathematics    Statistics    Python    Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python    Data Visualization    Machine Learning    Deep Learning    Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order.

Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.    So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.     We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field  – having all the necessary resources in one place.     Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).    The Skills    1. Intro to Data and Data Science Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?      Why learn it?  As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.        2. Mathematics   Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.    We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.    Why learn it?     Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.     3. Statistics   You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.    Why learn it?     This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.     4. Python Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning. Why learn it?     When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language.        5. Tableau Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science. Why learn it?     A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers.        6. Advanced Statistics   Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.    Why learn it?     Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section.        7. Machine Learning   The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data  scientist  from a data  analyst.  This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.    Why learn it?     Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for  you  to control the machines.    ***What you get*** A $1250 data science training program    Active Q&A support    All the knowledge to get hired as a data scientist    A community of data science learners    A certificate of completion    Access to future updates    Solve real-life business cases that will get you the job     You will become a data scientist from scratch     We are happy to offer an unconditional 30-day money back in full guarantee.

Dion's course was excellent. It was all I needed, and I took his practice tests I also purchased. The only thing I think would help other testers is more sophisticated and harder performance-based questions as I experienced ones today that were pretty tough and required more hands-on experience. Overall, though completely worth the money. (Duran navarro, 5 stars) The course is very informative and good for people that has no knowledge about cybersecurity so far. It teaches us about the harm caused by attacks and how to prevent them. I would suggest everyone to take this course, even if they don't wan the certificate from Comptia.  (Mahmoud Choumar, 5 stars) Jason is a great pedagogue. He is thorough and amiable. The course has very minimal errors and you can tell he is very strict with the format of his lessons. I had very few questions during the lectures and only experience one issue throughout the whole experience. I will definitely buy more courses from him. I also bought the voucher from his website to get the retake for only 100 bucks! Good job Dion Training! Keep up the great job! (Victor Cabrales, 5 stars) Passed the exam in December of 2022 using this course - FIRST TRY!! This course gave the back bone of everything I needed to pass the Sec. + exam. When the time came to study up a day or two before the actual exam, I used all the practice quizzes/tests from the CompTIA Sec. + study book. Seems thoughtless or stupid to not use the book for actual studying, but I found I learn slightly better in a class environment and this course/videos allowed me that. Thank you for this course and I look forward to many more in the future! Honestly, I haven't taken an ACTUAL exam in years - many years. If I can do it, you all can too! Good luck and God speed! (Nathaniel Shumaker, 5 stars) Upon completion of this course, you will earn 21 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",€159.99,en_US

I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it, as it is the  BEST Swift programming class  I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store."" - Ian Hopjins ""SO GOOD!!!  Retention rate is incredible  because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5""  - Muhammad Ibrahim ""Angela is a  spectacular  teacher!""  - Marco Zanirato ""This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I  realized how good this course  was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept."" - Marc ""Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but  Angela made me a pro  in weeks.""  - Burak Tunçbilek ""IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of  this course is built to make you learn, not just watch  and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!""  - Eduard Khachian Are you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this: I have revamped my expectation for what a  5 star course  should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!  - Alberto L ""I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome,  deep and clear ."" - Žan Fras ""I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the  best explanation  on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable."" - Bryan Pukanda ""I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which  i did not want it to end . It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course."" - Arun Lakhera ""I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say ""just do this. You will see why later."" She goes into the  reason for doing something  before doing it.""  - Clyde Addison Do you have some experience developing iOS apps and wonder if this course is for you? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this: ""This is the best-organized course for starting Swift that I've seen. The course is excellent for teaching Swift programming including vital information using Xcode, Github, Cocoapods, Stack Overflow, Alamofire, Firebase, REST APIs and all the services commonly used by app developers. They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly.  Wish I had this course a year ago  but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone's instructional videos, seriously. :)"" - Marcy Vernon ""Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming. I've been coding for years and taken many programming related classes on Udemy and this is def. one of the best. The instructor walks you through all the in's and out's of developing apps for the iOS platform.

I will wait here... ... Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be? Well, I'm here to teach you  HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw , step-by-step. So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone. But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to  enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project . So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn: The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project ( www.omnifood.dev ). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid! How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!). How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design) How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today! Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading... [01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place? Building websites allows you to do  fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well . Web development is one of the  most future-proof and highest-paying industries  in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world! But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place! This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an  all-in-one package  that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day. [02] Why is this course so unique and popular? Reason #1: The course is completely project-based Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by  building actual projects ! In the final project ( www.omnifood.dev ), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a  fictional company  that I made up just for the course. Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire  7-step process  of building and launching our website project. So the huge Omnifood project will teach you  real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites : how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more. On top of that, this course has a  huge focus on beautiful design . In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together. Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be  quite easy and fun to learn . With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in. My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn. Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and  designed the ideal course curriculum  for every type of student. It's a  unique blend  of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it! [03] Why is this course so long? Reason #1:  I take time to  explain every single concept  that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen ( this is a course , not a tutorial) Reason #2:  I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful! Reason #3:  There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually  assimilate and practice  what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills [04] Here is what's also included in the package: Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students) Professional English captions (not the auto-generated ones) Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!) Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years Free support in the course Q&A 10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included) [05] This course is for you if... ... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website. ... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website. ... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!). Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.

Six years ago, I was sitting in the passenger seat of a car with my friend.    My friend turns to me and says ""It's incredible how much I've gotten done in this year! So much has changed.""   And all I could do is smile. Because for me, almost nothing had changed.   The truth is that we all want to use your time well. But in order to do so, you need to know certain principles you'll never learn in school.   I didn't want to face another year where nothing changed. That's why I went after the answers. And it's also why I made this course.   Inside, I'm going to share with you 7 specific steps you can take today to become more productive, taken from my course How To Double Your Productivity By Tomorrow Morning. If you take these ideas and apply them, I think you'll become more productive than you ever have before.

This is  Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Science Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python (V2) . The reason I made this course is because there is a huge gap for many students between machine learning ""theory"" and writing actual code. As I've always said: ""If you can't implement it, then you don't understand it"". Without basic knowledge of data manipulation, vectors, and matrices, students are not able to put their great ideas into working form, on a computer. This course closes that gap by teaching you all the basic operations you need for implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The goal is that,  after  you take this course, you will learn about machine learning algorithms, and implement those algorithms in code using the tools and techniques you learned in this course.

https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/,Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond,Obtain Modern C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and STL skills. C++14 and C++17 covered.  C++20 info see below.,"Which programming language is often seen as a badge of honor among software developers?   C++ Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume,  will often get you a job interview?   C++  Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?   C++ Why you should learn C++ Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years.  Not only is C++ popular, but it is also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow. There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++. These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems! Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator,  the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++. Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more. Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you? If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers. But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++  is because it is so powerful! What do I mean by powerful? C++ is super fast and is a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible. It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well. C++ can do many things that other languages just can't. That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++. Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn. How can a beginner learn C++? Find a good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language. Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses.  He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry. So not only will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taught at university level for many years. As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe. Which version of C++ should I learn? C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years.  It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++. Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17).   Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course. What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well? This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.   C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14.    So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.  It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time. What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course.  It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++. And even if you really do want to learn C++20,  the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++. If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++. Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course! Is C++ difficult to learn? With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity. There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there. But with the right instructor and the right training, you really can get up to speed with C++ quickly, and that's what this course is all about. What will I learn in this course? The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++. Key topics covered include. * Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion * Performing calculations and displaying results * Functions * Pointers * Using existing classes and creating objects * Creating your own classes * Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector * Constructors and Destructors * Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment  * How to overload operators * Using inheritance and class hierarchies * Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding  * Using smart pointers * Using stream I/O * An introduction to the C++ STL * An introduction to Exception Handling * And much more. How is this C++ course different from other courses? You will learn Modern C++, for one.   Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.   If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date. The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations. You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience as your instructor Frank has. What do I get out of learning C++? More career options for one!  C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development.    It's also heavily used in embedded applications.  Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!

In the last year one aspect of this – the world wide web – has kicked up a gear with the introduction of HTML5, the newest version of the code that makes the web tick. If you learn HTML5 along with CSS3 (the next level of web design used on all modern websites), you’ll have a recipe for success; and this course will show you how. Create a website from scratch with HMTL5 and CSS3 Build a complete functioning website section by section Gain a solid knowledge base of HMTL5and CSS3 for future, more complex projects Control your website’s appearance, functionality and navigability Discover how HTML5 and CSS3 can be used in other areas of the web Learn best practice techniques for building websites and web pages  Build Like a Pro with HMTL5 and CSS3 Design The only way to effectively learn HTML5 and CSS3 is by diving right in and building websites from the ground up. That’s exactly what this course does. Designed for complete beginners, you’ll create a complete website section by section during 35 lectures and 5 hours of content.  You’ll start by becoming familiar with HTML tags and how they’re used, followed by the use of attributes and common settings. Once you’ve got a handle on basic HTML, you’ll move on to the fun stuff: CSS. You’ll use CSS for fonts, colours, lists, navigation menus, and more, adding a new element to your website with each section. Links, layouts, tables, forms and videos are all covered too.  If you know how to use a web browser and a text editor, you’re all set up for this course already. No extra software or tools are needed, and you can choose your preferred option of each to get going. By the time you finish, you’ll know everything you need to know to create beautiful, functional, easy to use websites of any kind. About HTML5 and CSS3 HTML5 HTML or Hyper Text Mark-up Language is the language used for presenting websites and web content. HTML5 is the latest version, made official by the World Wide Web Consortium in 2014. Having a good grasp of HTML means you’ll be able to create, present and edit a whole variety of content on the web. CSS3 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) essentially ‘enhances’ HTML, giving developers and users more control over how pages and content is displayed. It is responsible for creating more visually engaging web pages, applications and interfaces. CSS3  is the latest version, and has many more  extended features than previous versions – although it is backwards compatible.",Free,en_US

There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria   “I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin   “This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen   And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself. Will this course give you core python skills? Yes it will.  There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course. Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence? No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming.  And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language. Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused. This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language. By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above.  Why should you take this course? There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience.  That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from. You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past. As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.   And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews. This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy. Here’s just some of what you’ll learn (It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course) ·       All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating ·       You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more. ·       Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python. ·       Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version. ·        How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.   IntelliJ  has both a  FREE  and PAID version, and you can use either in this course.  PyCharm will also work just fine. (Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).   Does the course get updated? It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released  every day , meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.    A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated.  Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things. For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results. We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well. What if you have questions? As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer  full support , answering any questions you have  7 days a week  (whereas many instructors answer just once per week,  or not at all ).  This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.  That’s just one reason why Tim was voted  top 10 in the  Udemy instructor awards  (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.   Student Quote: “ Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger There’s no risk either! This course comes with a  full 30 day money-back guarantee . Meaning if you are not completely satisfied with the course or your progress, simply let Tim or J-P know and they will refund you 100%, every last penny no questions asked. You either end up with Python skills, go on to develop great programs and potentially make an awesome career for yourself, or you try the course and simply get all your money back if you don’t like it…  You literally can’t lose.

An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.    Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.  Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.  He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation.

https://www.udemy.com/course/test-the-pyla-waters/,Python for linear algebra (for absolute beginners),Dip your feet into the amazing world of using Python code to understand vectors and matrices.,"This course provides an introduction to using Python to learn linear algebra. It is designed for people who have no (or little) previous exposure to Python or to linear algebra.  What is linear algebra? Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with vectors and matrices. A vector is a list of numbers, and a matrix is a spreadsheet of numbers. That sounds really simple, but linear algebra is at the heart of nearly all applied mathematics, including statistics, machine learning, AI, deep learning, image processing, telecommunications, video games, computer graphics, biomedical signal processing, and the list goes on and on... Why use Python to learn linear algebra? Many people find math difficult but coding easier. You will be amazed at how much better you can learn math by using Python as a tool.  What will you learn in this course? You will learn the basics of getting started with using Python and with using Python to learn mathematics. You'll see an overview of the major topics in linear algebra, although I do not go into a lot of depth on any particular topic.  By the end of this course, you will know enough to decide whether you want to learn more about Python and math.  What do you need to know before enrolling? Well, you need to know how to use a computer. But you don't need to know anything about computer programming or linear algebra. The only thing you really *need* for this course is the willingness to dedicate 2-3 hours of your time to learning something new. What do you have to lose? The entire course takes 2-3 hours to complete (2 hours of video content, and about an hour to complete the practice problems). This is a great way to see whether you want to continue studying Python for math and linear algebra. And if you decide that this isn't right for you, then you only spent a few hours on it, rather than investing in tens of hours and money. Really, you have nothing to lose! Who is your instructor? I have been teaching data analysis, scientific programming, statistics, and signal processing for almost 20 years. I have several best-seller courses here on Udemy and my courses have well over 10,000 high-ranked reviews (don't believe me -- check out the reviews on this and my other courses!). I take online teaching seriously (although I let a few jokes slip through now and then...), and I remain actively involved in making sure my courses are high quality and up-to-date.",Free,en_US

This course is designed to clear up the many misunderstandings about Cloud Computing and to give you a crystal clear and easy to understand explanation of exactly what it is, how it works, the different options available, the advantages provided and how much it's going to cost.   And I'm not just going to give you the theory, I'm going to show you practical examples which you can follow along with yourself so you'll understand exactly how Cloud Computing works in the real world.   I start off with a review in Module 1 of the traditional deployment models of On Premises and Colo so you can understand how Cloud changes things, then explain how server virtualisation revolutionised data center design and paved the way for Cloud.   Module 2 defines Cloud Computing by listing the Essential Characteristics of Cloud services.   You'll learn about the Cloud Service Models of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and XaaS in Module 3. I start with an overview of the different models and then dive deep into the details and options of each. I also give lab demos of how to deploy each type.   The Cloud Deployment Models of Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud are covered in Module 4.   Finally in Module 5 I list out the advantages of Cloud Computing and then break out the spreadsheet to show you how to do a TCO cost comparison when choosing between an On Premise or Cloud deployment for a real world workload.   A verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the basic cloud knowledge necessary to be an effective member of their IT team, and the motivation to complete further training and be a real asset to their company.

https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/,"Deep Learning A-Z™ 2023: Neural Networks, AI & ChatGPT Bonus",Learn to create Deep Learning Algorithms in Python from two Machine Learning & Data Science experts. Templates included.,"*** As seen on Kickstarter *** Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.       But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.       --- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---     Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there:       1. ROBUST STRUCTURE      The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.        That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.       2. INTUITION TUTORIALS     So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:  why you are doing what you are doing.  And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive  *feel*  for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.       With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.       3. EXCITING PROJECTS     Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?       Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.       Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:       Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem     Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition     Recurrent Neural Networks to predict Stock Prices     Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud     Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System     Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the  Netflix $1 Million prize     *Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.     4. HANDS-ON CODING      In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.        In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.        This is a course which naturally extends into your career.       5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT     Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?        Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.       In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.        No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed.        --- The Tools ---     Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!       TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.        PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.       So which is better and for what?        Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.       The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.       --- More Tools ---     Theano  is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.       Keras  is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.       --- Even More Tools ---     Scikit-learn  the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:         to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation     to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning     to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions       And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.        Plus, throughout the course we will be using Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays, Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.       --- Who Is This Course For? ---     As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.       If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,  then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course. You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.       If you already have experience with Deep Learning,  you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.       --- Real-World Case Studies ---     Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:       #1 Churn Modelling Problem     In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.        Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.        If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.       #2 Image Recognition     In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.        For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!       #3 Stock Price Prediction     In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to  “Artificial Intelligence” . Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.        The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!        In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.         #4 Fraud Detection     According to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.         This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.        This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.       #5 & 6 Recommender Systems     From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.       We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.        Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.       Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.       And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!         --- Summary ---     In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.        We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!

We perform these attacks on our virtual machines and cover another really important tool for an ethical hacker: Metasploit Framework.   The goal of exploitation is to get on that target machine. This means we must drop a payload on that target machine so we can use it to navigate through their systems, look through their files, execute anything we want, and delete anything we want without the target knowing anything about it.   We will also learn to create our own Viruses and Trojans that we can deliver to the target whether through an email or through an USB. What is Exploitation ? What is a Vulnerability ? Reverse Shells, Bind Shells .. Metasploit Framework Structure Msfconsole Basic Commands Our First Exploit - vsftp 2.3.4 Exploitation Misconfigurations Happen - Bindshell Exploitation Information Disclosure - Telnet Exploit Software Vulnerability - Samba Exploitation Attacking SSH - Bruteforce Attack Exploitation Challenge - 5 Different Exploits Explaining Windows 7 Setup Eternal Blue Attack - Windows 7 Exploitation DoublePulsar Attack - Windows Exploit BlueKeep Vulnerability - Windows Exploit Routersploit Router Default Credentials Setting Up Vulnerable Windows 10 Crashing Windows 10 Machine Remotely Exploiting Windows 10 Machine Remotely Generating Basic Payload With Msfvenom Advance Msfvenom Usage Generating Powershell Payload Using Veil TheFatRat Payload Creation Hexeditor & Antiviruses Making Our Payload Open An Image 7. POST EXPLOITATION - This is what comes after Exploitation. Post exploitation is what we do on the target machine after we have exploited it. Since we are on that machine we can do many things depending on what we want to get out from it.   At the end, after we do all of the things we wanted, we want to make sure we cover our tracks by deleting any event logs or deleting any evidence that we were ever on that machine. Post Exploitation Theory Meterpreter Basic Commands Elevating Privileges With Different Modules Creating Persistence On The Target System Post Exploitation Modules Python Coding Project - Backdoor 8. WEBSITE PENETRATION TESTING - This is another big topic for an ethical hacker. In this section, we are mainly targeting websites and their bugs/vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be anything from misconfigurations, SQL Injections  (us interacting with the database) , Information Disclosures  (having access to some information by mistake which shouldn't be out there) , Command Injection ( directly interacting with the system through the webpage) , XSS  (Cross Site Scripting Attack and Injecting Javascript code on the page) . Website Penetration Testing Theory HTTP Request & Response Information Gathering & Dirb Tool Burpsuite Configuration ShellShock Exploitation Command Injection Exploitation Getting Meterpreter Shell With Command Execution Reflected XSS & Cookie Stealing Stored XSS HTML Injection SQL Injection CSRF Vulnerability Hydra Bruteforce Attack   Burpsuite Intruder Python Coding Project - Login Brute-force + Directory Discovery 9. MAN IN THE MIDDLE - This is an attack that is used inside a network. This allows us to sniff any unencrypted data and see it in plain text. This could also include seeing passwords in plain text for some websites. There are many tools out there that can perform this attack for us and we cover some of the main ones in the section. Theory - Man In The Middle Attack Bettercap ARP Spoofing Ettercap Password Sniffing Manually Poisoning Targets ARP Cache With Scapy 10. WIFI CRACKING - This is the section where we want to gain access to a network by cracking its wireless password.   Wireless Cracking Theory Putting Wireless Card In Monitor Mode Deauthenticating Devices & Grabbing Password Aircrack Password Cracking Hashcat Password Cracking 11. SOCIAL ENGINEERING - This is something we cover in almost every section. Social Engineering is an attack on humans since as we know people are always the weakest security! + much much more! We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online course on hacking and security skills! Have a look at the course outline video to see all the topics we are going to cover, all the projects we’re going to build, and all the techniques you’re going to learn to become a top ethical hacker and penetration tester! Taught By: Andrei is the instructor of the  highest rated technical courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.  His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.  Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.  Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.  He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible. -------- Aleksa is a Penetration Tester with over 5 years of experience in Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security. As a self made hacker that started from a young age he has learned it all from Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security to Online Privacy and How To Become Anonymous Online. He has worked and discovered vulnerabilities for multiple companies and governments.  He also worked as a freelancer that tested private web applications. He believes that Online Security and Privacy is something valuable but also that it doesn't get enough attention as many cyber attacks are being executed every single day! No System is Safe and that is why we are here to discover vulnerabilities and secure them before the bad guys attempt anything malicious! His main goal as an instructor is to teach the foundations of Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security to anyone who wants to pursue this as a career or wants to learn it to protect themselves online. Cyber attacks and online security is something that changes really fast so we as hackers must always be ready to learn new things in order to better protect Networks, Websites, Machines .. and also people!

Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!"" - Jerome Llouche ""You will not find a better teacher than Angela. She does a wonderful job of encouraging you to learn swift the right way. I want to encourage everyone thinking about taking this class to get it, as it is the  BEST programming class  I've seen on anywhere and I've tried more than a few of them. If you are looking for an excellent swift programming course, stop there here because you have found it. You will learn Swift from the very beginning of programming all the way through making your own apps that you can upload to the App store."" - Ian Hopjins ""SO GOOD!!!  Retention rate is incredible  because Angela does a great job in explaining and teaching every aspect of what we are doing. Most of the other instructors on Udemy put code on the screen and pretend nothing happened. This course is amazing! 5/5""  - Muhammad Ibrahim ""Angela is a  spectacular  teacher!""  - Marco Zanirato ""This course was terrific. Only after taking a few more courses from others that I  realized how good this course  was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept."" - Marc ""Best use of your money! I was a complete beginner but  Angela made me a pro  in weeks.""  - Burak Tunçbilek ""IT IS #1!!!!!!!!! Absolutely Amazing. The best iOS course i have ever taken. Angela explains everything the way it needs to be explained, so everything is easily understood. The concept of  this course is built to make you learn, not just watch  and repeat. Angela is highly educated and it is very much noticeable during the entire course. Again, it is fantastic. Thank you. Please create more courses!!!!!""  - Eduard Khachian Are you trying to choose between all the different Flutter courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this: I have revamped my expectation for what a  5 star course  should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!  - Alberto L ""I took a lot of courses on Udemy and elsewhere and non of them were as clear and perfectly paced as this one! Angelas approach is really awesome,  deep and clear ."" - Žan Fras ""I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the  best explanation  on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable."" - Bryan Pukanda ""I have taken lots of courses on udemy and elsewhere for self learning and i can tell you with all the honesty this is one course which  i did not want it to end . It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course."" - Arun Lakhera ""I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say ""just do this. You will see why later."" She goes into the  reason for doing something  before doing it.""   - Clyde Addison REMEMBER… I'm so confident that you'll love this course that we're offering a FULL money back guarantee for 30 days!

https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/,Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide,"Build, test, and deploy Docker applications with Kubernetes while learning production-style development workflows","If you're tired of spinning your wheels learning how to deploy web applications, this is the course for you. CI+CD Workflows ? You will learn it.   AWS Deployment ? Included.   Kubernetes in Production ? Of course! This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy  any  web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps.  Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination. Docker from Scratch! In this course you'll  learn Docker from absolute fundamentals , beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as ""What is a container?"" and ""How does a container work?"".  From the very first few lectures, we will do a  deep dive on the inner workings of containers , so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.   CI + CD Pipelines Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement  a full CI + CD workflow  using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that  automatically deploys your code  every time you push your latest changes to Github! Multi-Container Deployments on AWS! After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container  deployments on Amazon Web Services.   You will construct a multi-container application utilizing  Node, React, Redis, and Postgres , and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS). Kubernetes! Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the  right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster  - this course doesn't have any of those annoying  ""don't do this in production""  comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to  set up HTTPS on Kubernetes , which is harder than it sounds! Here's what you'll do: Learn Docker from scratch,  no previous experience required Build your own  custom images  tailored to your applications Master the Docker CLI to  inspect and debug  running containers Understand  how Docker works  behind the scenes, and what a container is Build a  CI + CD pipeline  from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS Automatically deploy  your code when it is pushed to Github! Build a  complex multi-container application  from scratch and deploy it to AWS Understand the purpose and  theory of Kubernetes Deploy a  production-ready Kubernetes  Cluster to Google Cloud",€109.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/,The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery,"Learn to code and become a Web Developer in 2023 with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, Machine Learning & more!","Just Updated for 2023!  Become a Fullstack Web Developer by learning the most in demand skills!   Graduates of this course are now working at companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Shopify, JP Morgan, Facebook + other top tech companies (...seriously). Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto as a Senior Developer and Tech Lead.  This is  the  tutorial you've been looking for to  become a modern web developer in 2023.  It doesn’t just cover a small portion of the industry. This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.  Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this Web Development course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet: I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills!  There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include  tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2023. After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course.  You are going to go from absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using a Machine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course. Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer. This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto.  I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies.  I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience). Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.  I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics. I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!  We have a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself.  You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).  The course is designed to  give you employable skills so you can get a job . Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away:  ""I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.    After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course. I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job.   So thanks Andrei , I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project."" - J.C. Think of this course like a Web Developer bootcamp. By the end, you will be comfortable using the below skills and you will be able to put them on your resume: HTML/HTML5 CSS/CSS3 SemanticUI Responsive Design Flexbox CSS Grid Bootstrap 5 DOM Manipulation Javascript (including ES6/ES7/ES8/ES9/ES10/ES2020/ES2021/ES2022) Asynchronous JavaScript HTTP/JSON/AJAX React + Redux + React Hooks Git + Github Command Line Node.js Express.js NPM RESTful API Design PostgresSQL SQL Authentication Authorization Scalable Infrastructure Security Production and Deployment You will be taken through online videos and exercises where you will be able to do the following things by the end: Build real complex applications and websites Build an image recognition app so you can add it to your portfolio Go into a job interview confident that you understand the fundamental building blocks of web development and the developer trends in 2023 Be able to go off on your own and grow your skills as a developer, having built a solid foundation Learn how frontend, servers, and databases communicate and how they all fit together in the eco system Build your own startup landing page Go off and work remotely by being a freelance developer that can bid on projects This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to that exact problem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps.  Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.    I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applications and cat image sliders. We are going to learn actual practical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are: React.js + Redux:  You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications. This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry. A day in the life of a developer:  What will your day to day look like and what tools will you use? I will take you through a sample day at a tech company. How does the internet actually work? What is the history of these technologies?:  You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are. How do you actually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:  How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way? What is Machine Learning and how you can harness its power:  Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.  What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:  We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry. Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age,  just knowing HTML CSS and Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.  Make this the year that you took a risk, you learned highly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey.  This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this.  See you inside!     Taught by:   Andrei is the instructor of the  highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.  His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.  Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.  Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.  He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

In Agile Project Management you have direct input from your customer throughout the whole project. In Agile Project Management udemy you constantly reflect for improvement with sessions called Retrospectives. Agile Project Management shifts from traditional long documentation processes and long meetings to agile, lean processes, practices and rituals such as the daily standup.  In Agile Project Management roles blur, meaning everyone can participate on different tasks regardless of whether it's their ""official"" role or not. For example, not only testers test, but others too (if the teams decides that). Agile Project Management udemy, allows you to focus on value and the minimum required working solution known as the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). So you apply a basic/yet really important concept all the time: keep it simple!!! Don't build a Ferrari if all you need is a skateboard!

His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life. Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.  Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.  Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities. Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.  He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way. Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible. -------- Daniel is a design leader in tech with extensive experience in  helping startups build and iterate  on their products.

You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again. Sound familiar? I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node. The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB. The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.

By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others. Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Data Science and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is, you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects. Or they show you a lot of code and complex math on the screen, but they don't really explain things well enough for you to go off on your own and solve real life machine learning problems.  Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Data Science skills, or are coming from a different industry, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No!  This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no Data Science experience, to someone that can go off, forget about Daniel and Andrei, and build their own Data Science and Machine learning workflows.  Machine Learning has applications in Business Marketing and Finance, Healthcare, Cybersecurity, Retail, Transportation and Logistics, Agriculture, Internet of Things, Gaming and Entertainment, Patient Diagnosis, Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing, Government, Academia/Research, Recommendation Systems and so much more.

Taught By: Daniel Bourke: A self-taught Machine Learning Engineer who lives on the internet with an uncurable desire to take long walks and fill up blank pages. My experience in machine learning comes from working at one of Australia's fastest-growing artificial intelligence agencies, Max Kelsen. I've worked on machine learning and data problems across a wide range of industries including healthcare, eCommerce, finance, retail and more. Two of my favourite projects include building a machine learning model to extract information from doctors notes for one of Australia's leading medical research facilities, as well as building a natural language model to assess insurance claims for one of Australia's largest insurance groups. Due to the performance of the natural language model (a model which reads insurance claims and decides which party is at fault), the insurance company were able to reduce their daily assessment load by up to 2,500 claims. My long-term goal is to combine my knowledge of machine learning and my background in nutrition to work towards answering the question ""what should I eat?"". Aside from building machine learning models on my own, I love writing about and making videos on the process. My articles and videos on machine learning on Medium, personal blog and YouTube have collectively received over 5-million views. I love nothing more than a complicated topic explained in an entertaining and educative matter. I know what it's like to try and learn a new topic, online and on your own. So I pour my soul into making sure my creations are accessible as possible. My modus operandi (a fancy term for my way of doing things) is learning to create and creating to learn. If you know the Japanese word for this concept, please let me know. Questions are always welcome. -------- Andrei Neagoie: Andrei is the instructor of the  highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.  His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.  Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.  Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.    Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.  Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.  He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation.

https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/,The Git & Github Bootcamp,"Master the essentials and the tricky bits: rebasing, squashing, stashing, reflogs, blobs, trees, & more!","The following sentence is annoying, but also true:  the best time to learn Git was yesterday . Fortunately, the second best time is today!  Git is an essential tool for work in any code-related field, from data science to game development to machine learning.  This course covers everything you need to know to start using Git and Github in the real-world today! The course's 20+ sections are broken down into four separate units: Git Essentials  Next Level Git Github & Collaboration The Tricky Bits We start off with  Git Essentials.   The goal of this unit is to give you all the essential Git tools you need for daily use.  We start off talking about version control software, what it is, why it matters, and the history of Git.  Then we install Git and run through the Unix commands you'll need to work with Git (you can skip this if you're already familiar).  The bulk of this unit is focused on teaching the core Git mechanics like  committing  and  branching  and the associated concepts: the working directory, the repository, the staging area, etc.    We cover Git commands including: git init, git add, git commit, git status, git log, git branch, and git merge.  We end with a detailed look at branching,  merging , and  resolving conflicts .  Then we move on to out  Next Level Git  unit, where we cover additional commands and Git concepts that are extremely useful, but maybe not as ""core"" as the Git Essentials.  We start with a comprehensive look at the  gif diff  command and the various comparisons that we can make between commits, branches, the working directory, the staging area, and more!  We pay special attention to reading and parsing the dense output generated by diffs.  Then we shift our focus to stashing with the  git stash  command, a ""convenience command"" that many users love incorporating into their Git workflow.  Finally, we dive deep into  undoing changes and time traveling  with Git.  We learn how to revisit earlier work, detach and re-attach HEAD, and discard changes.  We cover git commands that help us undo changes including  git checkout ,  git restore ,  git reset , and  git revert . Next up, we change gears to focus on  Github & Collaboration .  We start by exploring Github (and similar tools) that host remote repositories and discussing the benefits they provide.  We create our own Github repositories and sync up changes between our remote and local repositories using the  git push ,  git pull , and  git fetch  commands.  We then focus on commonly used  collaboration workflows  that students may encounter in the real world:  feature branching ,  pull requests ,  forking & cloning , and more! We discuss  contributing to open source  projects and configuring Github repositories for collaboration. We also spend some time learning about useful Github features including Github  Gists  and  Github Pages  for free static hosting. The last unit in the course,  The Tricky Bits , is really just a collection of useful Git command and advanced topics.  We start by covering one of the ""scarier"" Git commands:  rebasing !  We discuss the potential benefits and pitfalls of rebasing and compare it to merging.  Then we learn how to clean up our Git history by rewording, editing, dropping, and  squashing  commits using the  interactive rebase  command.  Next, we discuss  Git tags  (lightweight and  annotated tags ) semantic versioning and tagging workflows.  After that, we move on to a deep dive into the inner workings of Git.  We discuss the files and folders Git uses internally, the role of  hashing  functions in Git, and the role of Git objects ( blobs ,  trees , etc.). Next, we talk about reference logs and the  git reflog  command.  Specifically, we learn how we can use reflogs to rescue ""lost"" commits and  undo rebases .  Finally, we learn how to write custom and powerful  Git aliases ! Throughout the course, you'll find tons and tons of diagrams and visual references I've created to try and explain Git.  The course also includes exercises I've tested on my in-person students, to give you an opportunity to practice the concepts in the course along the way.  If you are reading this sentence, I congratulate you on making it this far :) I hope you enjoy the course!",€119.99,en_US

Course Statistics: Over 125,000 students in my courses! Over 7,000 5-star reviews in my courses! Earn PDU's:  Students who complete this course are eligible to receive 0.75 PDU's in PMI continuing education credits.  Instructions for claiming PDU's are provided with the last lesson in the course. Qualify for PMI-ACP Certification:   Completion of all seven courses in this series will meet the requirement for 21 hours of training to qualify for PMI-ACP certification. Course Summary: Learn to see Agile and traditional plan-driven project management principles and practices in a fresh new perspective as complementary to each other rather than competitive in order to get the best of these two worlds! Many businesses and project managers are faced with a choice of choosing a traditional plan-driven approach (or what is sometimes called “Waterfall"") or a more Agile approach for critical projects which can be a very important decision with significant business impact but there are many stereotypes and misconceptions that exist about both “Agile"" and “Waterfall"" that can be very confusing and misleading.  Many people see this as a binary and mutually-exclusive choice between two extremes and attempt to force-fit projects to one of these two approaches when the right solution is to go in the other direction and fit the approach to the project.  Since this is such a critical decision that has such a big impact, it's very important to get past these stereotypes and misconceptions, develop a clear objective understanding of what it means (or doesn't mean) when people talk about ""Agile versus Waterfall"".  Special Note: This course is part of an overall curriculum that is designed around helping students develop the skills required for a high-impact Agile Project Management role.  Most students will want to take the complete curriculum rather than individual courses.  The complete curriculum should be taken in the following order: Agile PM 101 - Learn the Truth About Agile versus Waterfall Agile PM 102 - What's the Future of Agile Project Management?

https://www.udemy.com/course/fun-tricks/,Mathematics: Fun tricks for everybody,Mathematics from high school to university,"Mathematics is often thought of as a tool for engineering or finances, but it is not its only purpose. Mathematics is also a product of the human mind which has an aesthetic function: to satisfy the human need of completeness, to give intellectual satisfaction, and even delight. This course shows mathematics as art, not as craft. It can help you fall in love (possibly: again) with mathematics, or at least help you understand the math lovers who always praise the beauty of maths. All the problems solved in this course are solved with help of really simple tricks, without using complicated theories. Some of them were presented in my earlier (free) course ""Mathematics: Proofs by induction"". In this earlier course, the formulas were proven by induction, while in the present course they are *derived*, so that you don't need to know the result in advance, which you really needed in case of proofs by induction. In some cases you will also get  geometrical interpretations  of the obtained results ( yes: the three rectangles in the course image ). Because of the time restriction (max 2 hours of video content) for free courses, some problems are solved in articles added as resources for the course. All the problems are on high-school level, but the course can be interesting for anybody who wants to see some recreational mathematics and learn some neat tricks. The following types of problems are presented here: In Section 1:  Several formulas for  sums  of elements in sequences of numbers: some arithmetic progressions (sum of all the natural numbers from 1 to n in Lecture 2, sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to 2n-1 in Lecture 3), a geometric progression (Lecture 8), the sequence of the squares of natural numbers (Lecture 4), two less known sequences (in Lectures 5 and 6); in three cases (Lectures 2, 3, and 8) you get nice geometrical interpretations of the results. One formula for a  product  of elements in a sequence of numbers (in Lecture 7). In Section 2:  Two divisibility problems (Lectures 9 and 10) and one inequality (Lecture 11). In Section 3:  In the last section (articles only, no videos) you will get introduced to three different situations where a similar trick is applied: getting rid of infinitely many operations by applying some smart substitutions, and solving some equations (linear or quadratic, with one unknown): -- infinite periodic decimal expansions (Lecture 12) -- infinite periodic continued-fraction expansions (Lecture 13) -- infinitely many times nested square roots (Lecture 14).",Free,en_US

Would you like to become a more complete and in-demand developer? Then Node.js is the hot technology for you to learn right now, and you came to the right place to do it! Welcome to the Complete Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Bootcamp, your fast track to modern back-end development. This course is the perfect all-in-one package that will take you from a complete beginner to an advanced, highly-skilled Node.js developer. Like all my other courses, this one is completely project-based! And not just any project: it's a complete, beautiful, and feature-rich application, containing both a RESTful API and a server-side rendered website. It's the most fantastic and complete project that you will find in any Node.js course on the internet! By building this huge project, you will learn all the skills that you need in order to plan, build, and deploy your own modern back-end applications with Node.js and related technologies. (If you feel like exploring the project, you can do so at www[.]natours[.]dev. And this is only a small part of the project! Log in with ""laura@example.com"" and password ""test1234"") After finishing this course, you will: 1)  Be building you own fast, scalable, and powerful Node.js RESTful APIs or web applications; 2)  Truly understand how Node.js works behind the scenes; 3)  Be able to work with NoSQL data and model data in real-world situations (a hugely important skill); 4)  Know how modern back-end development works, and how all the different technologies fit together (hard to understand from scattered tutorials and videos); 5)  Have experience in professionally-used tools and libraries like Express, Mongoose, Stripe, Sendgrid, Atlas, Compass, Git, Heroku, and many more; 6)  Have built a complete application, which is a perfect starting point for your own applications in the future. Please note that this course is  NOT  for absolute web development beginners, so you should already be familiar with basic JavaScript.  NO  back-end experience required though! It's an absolutely full-packed, deep-dive course with over 40 hours of content! Since this is the ""Complete Node.js Bootcamp"", the course is crammed with tons of different technologies, techniques, and tools, so that you walk away from the course as a complete Node.js developer. That's why the course turned out to be over 40 hours long. But if that sounds like too much for you, don't worry, there are videos or entire sections that you can safely skip. Here is exactly what you're gonna learn: Fundamentals of Node.js, core modules, and NPM (Node Package Manager) How Node.js works behind the scenes: event loop, blocking vs non-blocking code, event-driven architecture, streams, modules, etc. Fundamentals of Express (Node.js framework): routing, middleware, sending responses, etc. RESTful API design and development with advanced features: filtering, sorting, aliasing, pagination Server-side website rendering (HTML) with Pug templates CRUD operations with MongoDB database locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud) Advanced MongoDB: geospatial queries, aggregation pipeline, and operators Fundamentals of Mongoose (MongoDB JS driver): Data models, CRUD operations, data validation, and middleware Advanced Mongoose features: modeling geospatial data, populates, virtual populates, indexes, etc. Using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture How to work with data in NoSQL databases Advanced data modelling: relationships between data, embedding, referencing, and more Complete modern authentication with JWT: user sign up, log in, password reset, secure cookies, etc. Authorization (user roles) Security: best practices, encryption, sanitization, rate limiting, etc. Accepting credit card payments with Stripe: Complete integration on the back-end and front-end Uploading files and image processing Sending emails with Mailtrap and Sendgrid Advanced error handling workflows Deploying Node.js application to production with Heroku Git and GitHub crash course And so much more! Why should you learn Node.js and take this course? If you want to learn Node.js and modern back-end development, then there is no doubt that this course is for you! It's the biggest Node.js course on the internet, it has by far the most complete course project, and offers the most in-depth explanations of all topics included. And even if you already know some Node.js, you should still take this course, because it contains subjects that are not covered anywhere else, or not in the same depth! But maybe you're not yet convinced that Node.js really is the right technology for you to learn right now? Well, first, Node.js will allow you to use your JavaScript skills to build applications on the back-end. That itself is a huge gain, which makes your full-stack development process so much easier and faster. Plus, popularity and opportunities for Node.js are off the charts. It's a modern, proven, and reliable technology, used by tech giants (and 6-figure-salary-paying-companies) like Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and many more. Node.js really is what you should invest your time in, instead of outdated technology like PHP. In summary, if you already know JavaScript, learning Node is the logical next step for you!  It will make you a better, more versatile, and more complete developer, which will ultimately boost your opportunities in the job market! And I created this course to help you do exactly that!

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-analyst-course-complete-data-analyst-bootcamp/,The Data Analyst Course: Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp,"Complete Data Analyst Training: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Data Collection, Preprocessing, Data Types, Data Visualization","The problem Most data analyst, data science, and coding courses miss a critical practical step. They don’t teach you how to work with raw data, how to clean, and preprocess it. This creates a sizeable gap between the skills you need on the job and the abilities you have acquired in training. Truth be told, real-world data is messy, so you need to know how to overcome this obstacle to become an independent data professional. The bootcamps we have seen online and even live classes neglect this aspect and show you how to work with ‘clean’ data. But this isn’t doing you a favour. In reality, it will set you back both when you are applying for jobs, and when you’re on the job. The solution Our goal is to provide you with complete preparation. And this course will turn you into a job-ready data analyst. To take you there, we will cover the following fundamental topics extensively. Theory about the field of data analytics Basic Python Advanced Python NumPy Pandas Working with text files Data collection Data cleaning Data preprocessing Data visualization Final practical example Each of these subjects builds on the previous ones. And this is precisely what makes our curriculum so valuable. Everything is shown in the right order and we guarantee that you are not going to get lost along the way, as we have provided all necessary steps in video (not a single one skipped). In other words, we are not going to teach you how to analyse data before you know how to gather and clean it. So, to prepare you for the entry-level job that leads to a data science position - data analyst - we created The Data Analyst Course. This is a rather unique training program because it teaches the fundamentals you need on the job. A frequently neglected aspect of vital importance. Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course provides complete preparation for someone who wants to become a data analyst at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save). We believe that this resource will significantly boost your chances of landing a job, as it will prepare you for practical tasks and concepts that are frequently included in interviews. The topics we will cover 1. Theory about the field of data analytics 2. Basic Python 3. Advanced Python 4. NumPy 5. Pandas 6. Working with text files 7. Data collection 8. Data cleaning 9. Data preprocessing 10. Data visualization 11. Final practical example 1. Theory about the field of data analytics Here we will focus on the big picture. But don’t imagine long boring pages with terms you’ll have to check up in a dictionary every minute. Instead, this is where we want to define who a data analyst is, what they do, and how they create value for an organization. Why learn it? You need a general understanding to appreciate how every part of the course fits in with the rest of the content. As they say, if you know where you are going, chances are that you will eventually get there. And since data analyst and other data jobs are relatively new and constantly evolving, we want to provide you with a good grasp of the data analyst role specifically. Then, in the following chapters, we will teach you the actual tools you need to become a data analyst. 2. Basic Python This course is centred around Python. So, we’ll start from the very basics. Don’t be afraid if you do not have prior programming experience. Why learn it? You need to learn a programming language to take full advantage of the data-rich world we live in. Unless you are equipped with such a skill, you will always be dependent on other people’s ability to extract and manipulate data, and you want to be  in dependent while doing analysis, right? Also, you don’t necessarily need to learn many programming languages at once. It is enough to be very skilled at just one, and we’ve naturally chosen Python which has established itself as the number one language for data analysis and data science (thanks to its rich libraries and versatility). 3. Advanced Python We will introduce advanced Python topics such as working with text data and using tools such as list comprehensions and anonymous functions. Why learn it? These lessons will turn you into a proficient Python user who is independent on the job. You will be able to use Python’s core strengths to your advantage. So, here it is not just about the topics, it is also about the depth in which we explore the most relevant Python tools. 4. NumPy NumPy is Python’s fundamental package for scientific computing. It has established itself as the go-to tool when you need to compute mathematical and statical operations. Why learn it? A large portion of a data analyst’s work is dedicated to preprocessing datasets. Unquestionably, this involves tons of mathematical and statistical techniques that NumPy is renowned for. In addition, the package introduces multi-dimensional array structures and provides a plethora of built-in functions and methods to use while working with them. In other words, NumPy can be described as a computationally stable state-of-the-art Python instrument that provides flexibility and can take your analysis to the next level. 5. Pandas The pandas library is one of the most popular Python tools that facilitate data manipulation and analysis. It is very valuable because you can use it to manipulate all sorts of information - numerical tables and time series data, as well as text. Why learn it? Pandas is the other main tool an analyst needs to clean and preprocess the data they are working with. Its data manipulation features are second to none in Python because of the diversity and richness it provides in terms of methods and functions. The combined ability to work with both NumPy and pandas is extremely powerful as the two libraries complement each other. You need to be capable to operate with both to produce a complete and consistent analysis independently. 6. Working with text files Exchanging information with text files is practically how we exchange information today. In this part of the course, we will use the Python, pandas, and NumPy tools learned earlier to give you the essentials you need when importing or saving data. Why learn it? In many courses, you are just given a dataset to practice your analytical and programming skills. However, we don’t want to close our eyes to reality, where converting a raw dataset from an external file into a workable Python format can be a massive challenge. 7. Data collection In the real world, you don’t always have the data readily available for you. In this part of the course, you will learn how to retrieve data from an API. Why learn it? You need to know how to source your data, right? To be a well-rounded analyst you must be able to collect data from outside sources. This is rarely a one-click process. This section aims at providing you with all the necessary tools to do that on your own. 8. Data cleaning The next logical step is to clean your data. This is where you will apply the pandas skills acquired earlier in practice. All lessons throughout the course have a real-world perspective. Why learn it? A large part of a data analyst’s job in the real world involves cleaning data and preparing it for the actual analysis. You can’t expect that you’ll deal with flawless data sources, right? So, it will be up to you to overcome this stage and clean your data. 9. Data preprocessing Even when your dataset is clean and in an understandable shape, it isn’t quite ready to be processed for visualizations and analysis just yet. There is a crucial step in between, and that’s data  pre processing. Why learn it? Data preprocessing is where a data analyst can demonstrate how good or great they are at their job. This stage of the work requires the ability to choose the right statistical tool that will improve the quality of your dataset and the knowledge to implement it with advanced pandas and NumPy techniques. Only when you’ve completed this step can you say that your dataset is preprocessed and ready for the next part, which is data visualization. 10. Data visualization Data visualization is the face of data. Many people look at the data and see nothing. The reason for that is that they are not creating good visualizations. Or even worse – they are creating nice graphs but cannot interpret them accurately. Why learn it? This part of the course will teach you how to use your data to produce meaningful insights. At the end of the day, data charts are what conveys the most information in the shortest amount of time. And nothing speaks better than a well crafted and meaningful data visualization. 11. Practical example The course contains plenty of exercises and practical cases. In the end, we have included a comprehensive practical example that will show you how everything you have learned along the way comes nicely together. This is where you will be able to appreciate how far you have come in your journey to becoming a data analyst and starting your data career.

https://www.udemy.com/course/proofs-by-induction/,Mathematics: Proofs by induction,Mathematics from high school to university,"How would you prove that a theorem or a formula is true for *all* natural numbers? Try it for n=0, n=1, n=2, etc? It seems to be a lot of work, or even completely impossible, as there are infinitely many natural numbers! Don't worry, there is a solution to this problem. This solution is called ""proof by induction"" and this is the subject of this short (and free) course.  The Induction Principle  is often compared to the ""domino effect"", which will be illustrated in the course. (This is also the reason for our course image.) In this course you will learn how induction proofs work, when to apply them (and when not), and how to conduct them. You will get an illustration of this method on a variety of examples: some formulas, some inequalities, some statements about divisibility of natural numbers.

I'm […] impressed with how the sections are broken down and have been placed into chronological order to help with understanding.”  – Laura  “Through my Agile journey, this is one of the top courses I have taken. Why? I enjoy this course because it goes over a large scheme of topics that are specific and useful, but also given to the learner in bite sized pieces.. This course is especially helpful if you are working in an Agile Team or looking to implement Agile into a team. I have a much clearer understanding on the ceremonies, structure of a team, team responsibilities and reasoning behind different pieces of software, such as Jira. I have gained a lot of knowledge from the course, quizzes, and activities that Jeremy and Vivek put together. I can absolutely see myself implementing what I have gained from this course into my team and future teams. Thanks for creating an easy to follow course!!”  - Meghann Learn how Agile works as well as how it fits into the world of Business Analysis This course is taught by  two  instructors, to ensure you get  total  coverage of the subject.

Let’s hear from some more students:  “I was certified as a Scrum Master over a decade ago and had been away from using scrum in a product management role for several years. This course helped me quickly regain an overview of the key principles and remind me of all of the artifacts and other key practices to put scrum to use again. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand Scrum or Kanban.”  – John  “Training by Jeremy and Vivek was awesome. They were able to explain in detail about all the concepts which will help anyone to understand and try to implement these practices. The good thing about Jeremy is his technique to break into pieces and explaining to avoid confusion. Look forward to learning more from you guys in the future lectures.”  - Venkatesh What’s included in the course? -  High-Quality Video Lectures  break down the complex terms and confusing Agile jargon to ensure you get a concrete understanding of the items being discussed -  Downloadable Handouts  help you to enhance your understanding and retention of the key concepts -  Quizzes and Activities  validate your learning and help to point out areas that should be reviewed for full comprehension -  1-on-1 Support  means that any confusion or questions you have can be addressed and cleared up easily (no more frantically googling trying to figure out what your course instructor means). -  Lifetime Access with NO Expiration  so you can learn at your own pace, and come back at any time you feel unsure or are in need of a refresher  “Not only the theoretical part associated to the Scrum Framework is good, but Jeremy and Vivek's experience, that is invaluable, thanks for that guys! [...] Jeremy and Vivek explained the terms and concepts in a logical and simple order way so it was much much easy to me to catch on all these concepts once and for all. Congrats to both!”  – Silvia  “While not 100% new to Agile, it had been some time since I worked in the environment so as a refresher this course is perfect. I also feel this would be a great course for beginners. The videos are clear and easy to listen to, with a good pace. I like the inclusion of printable material as it is true, when you write something down, you remember it easier. Well done Vivek and Jeremy.”  - Shelly What ELSE is included in the course?

Have you heard about the  power of ChatGPT  and want to use it to  create solutions and applications ? Do you want to seamlessly  integrate ChatGPT into your business applications , like Outlook, Teams, Excel, Power Apps, Power Automate, and more? Do you want to build  full enterprise solutions and real-life web applications that use ChatGPT  and don't know where to start? Do you want to bring OpenAI's API into your application, platform, solution, or business? Do you want to build full  real examples applications and solutions with ChatGPT from beginning to end , including a  Cover Letter Generator, a Travel Itinerary Planner, a PPT Stock Generator, and an app that creates its own replies to email? Then this is the course for you.  Learn from more than 6 hours of relevant instructional video content , with the only course that will not just teach you how to use ChatGPT to increase your productivity, but also how to build real-life solutions and applications from scratch using ChatGPT. We will leverage this amazing AI model, along with other OpenAI models like DALL-E, to create business software from beginning to end. This course will teach you how to use the  OpenAI's API and integrate it into many different platforms , including Outlook, Power Apps, Power Automate, Airtable, Bubble, and many more. We will then take what we have learned and build some examples of real-life applications and solutions from scratch. What is this course all about? This course has one objective:  start building applications and solutions with ChatGPT . We do that by first learning more about OpenAI and ChatGPT, and how to use its APIs in our platforms. We then create a serverless function that can take ChatGPT prompts and return responses - the first step to integrate your ChatGPT into your application. After that, we learn to  integrate the ChatGPT API into many platforms, like Outlook, Power Apps, Power Automate, Teams, Bubbe, Airtable, and more.  Finally, we take all we've learned, and  create full applications and solution examples , like TravelPlan, a web application that helps users create itineraries through the power of ChatGPT. What is OpenAI? OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT - it's an AI research and deployment company that builds amazing AI models and provides them to the public via API for a per-use fee. It is based out of San Francisco and its investors include Microsoft. In fact, Microsoft has recently invested more than $10B into the company. What is ChatGPT? GPT-3 is a series of Language Generation models that was developed by OpenAI.  Its newest form, called Davinchi, is what is behind the ChatGPT program that we all know and love.  It grew to popularity in December 2022 after people started using it and seeing how amazing it deals with any Prompt-Response completion questions like ""write me a slogan for an ice cream company"" or ""explain to me Quantum Computing like I'm five years old"". What is OpenAI's API? OpenAI has an API (Application Programming Interface) for all of its GPT-3 models, including ChatGPT and Davinchi. It enables  any platform to talk directly to OpenAI's model , and this is the tool that lets us program OpenAI into any application or solution that we can think about., like Outlook, Power Apps, and much more. How do you create business solutions or applications using ChatGPT API? We create  applications and solutions by linking ChatGPT's API directly into an application or solution building platform.  For example, we learn how to integrate ChatGPT's API into Power Apps. After we do that, we can build any business application we want using Power Apps and it can now integrate ChatGPT. This is the same case for all the other platforms we cover. What are the different platforms that we will integrate ChatGPT into? We specifically go through Outlook, Teams, Power Automate, Power Apps, Bubble, and Airtable. We also go through how to add ChatGPT as an Azure Function. This enables us to extend ChatGPT to any single platform we want including React, Webflow, Zapier, Excel, and many more. What applications or solutions will we build in this course? Tchat  - a Teams chatbot that you can put into your business to answer any question CoverLetterCreator  - a Cover Letter generator based on a job description and reading a set of skills from a Resume TravelPlan  - enables users to create detailed itineraries after specifying a location they are traveling, how long they are going for, and what they want to do StockPhotoPPT  - creates images that users can put into their slide decks with ease PolitelySayNo  - craft emails that politely and professionally say no to tough requests from your manager Why learn how to integrate ChatGPT into your solutions and applications Improve your productivity  - imagine how easy it would be for ChatGPT to reply to your emails for you, or to create a first draft on your travel itinerary to China. With ChatGPT, you can do that. However, it may be annoying to use the chat feature - so instead why not integrate it directly into the tools you use most like Outlook, Excel, Airtable, and more. Build businesses  - many businesses have had AI at their centre. ChatGPT opens the doors for you to create applications and solutions that solve a problem ChatGPT can easily solve. For example, in this course, we create a Cover Letter Generator app that creates cover letters based on a job ad and resume. This can easily be monetized and converted into a successful business. Win with AI  - let’s face it, AI is the future. It is paramount that you include AI in your daily workflows as it can increase your efficiency and improve your output, no matter what job you have. Why choose this course? Complete guide  - this is the 100% start to finish, zero to hero, basic to advanced guide on building solutions and applications with ChatGPT.

It has 6 hours of instructional content! Platform driven  - we cover all popular platforms and applications that you would want to bring ChatGPT into, including Power Apps, Power Automate, Outlook, Bubble, Airtable, and more. We also showcase how to turn the ChatGPT API into your own Azure function, enabling you to deploy it anywhere, in any single application or solution. Structured to succeed  - this course is structured to help you succeed. We first go through a crash course on ChatGPT, then we learn how to integrate ChatGPT into different platforms, and then we build real life applications and solutions with these platforms. Fully instructional  - we not only go through important concepts, but also apply them as we are building our application so that we can solidify them. This is not only a walkthrough of all the features and theoretical concepts, but a course that actually builds applications with you. Step by step  - we go through every single concept in a sequential order (from learning about ChatGPT, connecting it to the platforms, and then creating examples. This improves your probabilities of learning these platforms to build solutions rather than going haphazardly through each feature. Learn to learn  - during the latter parts of the course, we go through situations where we encounter new features or errors, and work through how we would use the documentation to resolve them. In this way, you not only learn about these platforms and how they interact inside and out, but learn how to resolve your own issues as they come up.

SAMPLE QUESTION: A startup wants to set up its IT infrastructure on AWS Cloud. The CTO would like to get an estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the AWS services that the startup wants to use. As a Cloud Practitioner, which AWS service would you suggest for this use-case? AWS Pricing Calculator AWS Cost Explorer AWS Budgets AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer... Correct: 1. Correct option: AWS Pricing Calculator AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services. AWS Pricing Calculator can provide the estimate of the AWS service usage based on the list of AWS services. You should also note AWS is in the process of deprecating a similar tool called the Simple Monthly Calculator. This calculator provides an estimate of usage charges for AWS services based on certain information you provide. It helps customers and prospects estimate their monthly AWS bill more efficiently.  Incorrect options: AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR)  - The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available, including additional metadata about AWS services, pricing, credit, fees, taxes, discounts, cost categories, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans. The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) itemizes usage at the account or Organization level by product code, usage type and operation. These costs can be further organized by Cost Allocation tags and Cost Categories. The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) is available at an hourly, daily, or monthly level of granularity, as well as at the management or member account level. The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services. AWS Cost Explorer  - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends. AWS Cost Explorer cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services. AWS Budgets  - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others.  AWS Budgets cannot provide the estimate of the monthly AWS bill based on the list of AWS services.

https://www.udemy.com/course/completing-the-square/,Mathematics: Completing the square,Mathematics from high school to university,"Mathematics: Completing the square Mathematics from high school to university 1. Completing the square: how the method works, and why You will learn about the method of completing the square, how it works and why. This remarkable (and elementary!) method has surprisingly many applications in advanced mathematics, and this is why it is really good to master it. Geometrical illustrations will give you a nice visual explanation of both the method and the name of the method. 2. A glimpse into some applications of completing the square You will learn about various applications of completing the square, starting with quite elementary applications (high-school level) such as solving quadratic equations and drawing graphs of second degree polynomials, and continuing with some information about more advanced applications such as identifying quadratic curves and surfaces, determining definiteness of square matrices (or corresponding quadratic forms), and optimization of functions in two or more variables. These applications will  not  be treated in this course due to time constraints, but you will get information in which courses you find both theory and practice on the topics. You will also get some practice in completing the square. In this brief course I have chosen to inform you about applications of completing the square in Algebra, Calculus, and Linear Algebra and Geometry. A note : Another typical application of completing the square ( not  discussed in this course) is in Calculus 2, when you must integrate a rational function (a function of the type p(x)/q(x), where both p(x) and q(x) are polynomials). After performing partial fraction decomposition, you will represent your function as a sum of simpler fractions, with denominators being first-degree polynomials or second-degree polynomials without real zeros. This second type, when integrated, will lead to some function defined by arctan; in order to perform this integration in a correct way (variable substitution), you must... complete the square! You can learn about partial fraction decomposition in my course ""Precalculus 2: Polynomials and rational functions"", and about the integration method mentioned above in my upcoming course ""Calculus 2, part 1 of 2: Integrals with applications"". 3. Extras You will learn about our other (published) courses and about the courses we plan to create in the near future.",Free,en_US

It was truly a light-bulb moment, when I realized that Google has some answers - it could give me some of the code I was looking for - but there two things missing: The WHY  - why does the code work in one situation but not another. Structure  - topic sequence, real-case examples, workbooks, documentation. Don’t waste your time Don't waste your time on poor quality videos and confusing explanations. In this Excel VBA course, complex topics are taught in a simple way by an instructor with 17 years of experience.

SAMPLE QUESTION: A social gaming startup has its flagship application hosted on a fleet of EC2 servers running behind an Elastic Load Balancer. These servers are part of an Auto Scaling Group. 90% of the users start logging into the system at 6 pm every day and continue till midnight. The engineering team at the startup has observed that there is a significant performance lag during the initial hour from 6 pm to 7 pm. The application is able to function normally thereafter. As a solutions architect, which of the following steps would you recommend addressing the performance bottleneck during that initial hour of traffic spike? Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a scheduled action that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a lifecycle hook that kicks-off before 6 pm. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm. Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a target tracking policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm. Configure your Auto Scaling group by creating a step scaling policy. This causes the scale-out to happen even before peak traffic kicks in at 6 pm. What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer... Correct: 1. The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group to perform a scaling action at specified times. To create a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start time when the scaling action should take effect, and the new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling action. The engineering team can create a daily scheduled action to kick-off before 6pm and hence this is the correct option. Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks enable you to perform custom actions as the Auto Scaling group launches or terminates instances. For example, you could install or configure software on newly launched instances, or download log files from an instance before it terminates. Lifecycle hooks are not the correct choice for this use-case. With target tracking scaling policies, you choose a scaling metric and set a target value. Application Auto Scaling creates and manages the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling policy and calculates the scaling adjustment based on the metric and the target value. With step scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling process as well as define how your scalable target should be scaled when a threshold is in breach for a specified number of evaluation periods. Both the target tracking as well as step scaling policies entail a lag wherein the instances will be provisioned only when the underlying CloudWatch alarms go off. Therefore we would still see performance lag during some part of the initial hour. ======= Instructor My name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

Hi there! My name is Dan & I’m an Adobe Certified Instructor. I’m here to help you learn Adobe XD efficiently and comprehensively. XD is a fantastic design tool used by industry professionals to product high quality & functional mockups. By the end of this course, you will be able to produce practical and effective User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) designs. Throughout the course I’ll invite you to participate in a real-life freelance project which I’m working on. It’s a project that requires a fresh website and mobile app interface. This will prepare you for dealing with real world projects if you choose to move towards a UX/UI career path. Aria:  ""This course is definitely above expectations so far. I didn't expect to get so much insight into the briefing and the communication between UX Designer and a client. It helps to see the brief and to learn that there are different tiers of income based on projects and experience. Love It!"" This course is aimed at people interested in UI/UX Design. We’ll start from the very beginning and work all the way through, step by step. If you already have some UI/UX Design experience but want to get up to speed using Adobe XD then this course is perfect for you too! First, we will go over the differences between UX and UI Design. We will look at what our brief for this real-world project is, then we will learn about low-fidelity wireframes and how to make use of existing UI design kits. I’ll go over all of the essential tools necessary for creating excellent wireframes, including: type, colours, icons, Lorem ipsum, artboards, prototyping, models and popups, symbols and repeat grids. We will even make use of the new prototyping app so that you can experience your prototype on your mobile device. Kate:  Excellent course - Dan is an excellent teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed following along with his videos. Highly recommend! July 2018: I have updated this review with an extra star because of how useful this course has been in the months following it's completion. I am using Adobe XD daily and Dan's instruction was instrumental to adding this feather to my front-end web development hat. An important part of maximising your UX Design workflow is being able to utilise other software such as Photoshop and Illustrator. This is why I’ll be teaching you how to make use of both to help boost your XD productivity. One of the awesome new features of XD is micro-interactions. I’ll be teaching you all about those and how to use them to grow icons and scenes. This is one of the parts of web design that’s growing and being adopted rapidly so you won’t want to miss out on learning it early. Leigh:  ""I really enjoyed this course. I was a UX designer before the course and was looking for more information on XD and getting to know the program itself better, and this course really nailed it! It has great UX references and a few refreshing perspectives. As well as it really helps you learn XD in the process. The instructor is engaging and fun to listen to. Really really great course. I highly recommend to any new UX designers, as well as veterans looking for a refresh, or just to learn how to use XD."" There are two class projects for you to complete during this class, these will help develop your skills and will give you something for your own portfolio. It is now time to upgrade yourself & learn Adobe XD.",€99.99,en_US
https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-website-hacking-penetration-testing-from-scratch/,Website Hacking / Penetration Testing,Hack websites & web applications like black hat hackers and secure them like experts.,"Note: The contents of this course are not covered in any of my other courses except for some basics. Although website hacking is covered in one of my other courses, that course only covers the basics where this course  dives much deeper in this topic  covering more techniques, more vulnerabilities, advanced exploitation, advanced post exploitation, bypassing security and more! Welcome to my this comprehensive course on Website penetration testing. In this course you'll learn website / web applications hacking! This course assumes you have  NO prior knowledge  in hacking, and by the end of it you'll be at a high level, being able to  hack & discover bugs in websites like black-hat hackers  and  secure them like security experts!   This course is highly  practical  but it won't neglect the theory, first you'll learn how to install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we'll start with websites basics, the different components that make a website, the technologies used, and then we'll dive into website hacking straight away. From here onwards you'll  learn everything by example , by discovering vulnerabilities and exploiting them to hack into websites, so we'll never have any dry boring theoretical lectures. Before jumping into hacking, you'll first learn how to  gather comprehensive information  about the target website, then the course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers how to  discover, exploit and mitigate  a common web application vulnerability, for each vulnerability you will first learn the basic exploitation, then you will learn  advanced  techniques to  bypass security, escalate your privileges ,  access the database , and even use the hacked websites to hack into other websites on the same server. All of the vulnerabilities covered here are  very common in bug bounty programs , and most of them are part of the OWASP top 10. You will learn how and why these vulnerabilities are exploitable, how to fix them and what are the right practices to avoid causing them. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the course content: 1. Information Gathering  -  In this section you'll learn how to gather information about a target website, you'll learn how to discover its DNS information, the services used, subdomains, un-published directories, sensitive files, user emails, websites on the same server and even the hosting provider. This information is crucial as it increases the chances of being able to successfully gain access to the target website. 2. Discovery, Exploitation & Mitigation  -  In this section you will learn how to  discover, exploit and mitigate  a large number of vulnerabilities, this section is divided into a number of sub-sections, each covering a specific vulnerability, firstly you will learn  what is that vulnerability  and  what does it allow us to do , then you will learn how to  exploit  this vulnerability and  bypass  security, and finally we will analyse the  code causing this vulnerability  and see how to  fix  it, the following vulnerabilities are covered in the course: File upload  -   This vulnerability allow attackers to upload executable files on the target web server, exploiting these vulnerabilities properly gives you  full control over the target website . Code Execution  -  This vulnerability allow users to execute system code on the target web server, this can be used to execute malicious code and get a  reverse shell access  which gives the attacker  full control over the target web server. Local File Inclusion  -  This vulnerability can be used to read any file on the target server, so it can be exploited to  read sensitive files , we will not stop at that though, you will learn two methods to  exploit  this vulnerability to get a  reverse shell  connection which gives you  full control over the target  web server . Remote File Inclusion  -  This vulnerability can be used to load remote files, exploiting this vulnerability properly gives you  full control  over the target web server . SQL Injection  -   This is one of the  most dangerous  vulnerabilities, it is everywhere and can be exploited to do  all of the things the above vulnerabilities allow us to do and more , so it allows you to login as admin without knowing the password,  access the database  and get all data stored there such as usernames, passwords, credit cards ....etc, read/write files and even get a reverse shell access which gives you  full control over the target server! Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  -  This vulnerability can be used to inject javascript code in vulnerable pages, we won't stop at that, you will learn how to  steal credentials from users  (such as facebook or youtube  passwords ) and even gain  full access  to their computer. Insecure Session Management   - In this section you will learn how to exploit insecure session management in web applications and login to other user accounts without knowing their password, you'll also learn how to discover and exploit  CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)  vulnerabilities to force users to change their password, or submit any request you want . Brute Force & Dictionary Attacks   - In this section you will learn what are these attacks, the difference between them and how to launch them, in successful cases you will be able to  guess the password for a target user . 3. Post Exploitation  -  In this section you will learn  what can you do with the access you gained by exploiting the above vulnerabilities , you will learn how to convert reverse shell access to a Weevely access and vice versa, you will learn how to execute  system commands  on the target server, navigate between directories,  access other websites on the same server , upload/download files,  access the database  and even download the whole database to your local machine. You will also learn how to  bypass security  and do all of that even if you did not have enough permissions!  With this course you get  24/7 support , so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours. Notes:  This course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against systems that I have permission to test. This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih & zSecurity, no other organization is associated with it or a certification exam.

Learn Unreal Engine 5's new features from  Open World  maps,  Quixel Bridge  megascans for ultra-realistic environments, landscape  sculpting  and  painting ,  dungeons , free-roaming creatures and humanoids with various  weapons ,  breakable objects  that  spawn treasure , and more! Slay your way through your open world level, hacking and slashing creatures, breaking pots and collecting treasure and souls, and try to keep your health and stamina high!  We will implement enemy behavior that can be reused for various creature types, including gruntlings, raptors, insects, and golems. Code your character to be able to pick up and equip better and better weapons as she slays stronger and stronger monsters and collects loot. We will cover new Unreal Engine 5 features such as  Motion Warping ,  Meta Sounds ,  Linked Anim Graphs , UE5's new retargeting system with  IK Rigs  and  IK Retargeters ,  Leg IK  with  Control Rigs , visual effect creation in  Niagara , and more! We'll start with a completely empty level and add everything from sky and atmosphere, nature, trees and plants, and we'll even import an entire dungeon level with the use of UE5's new  Packed Level Instance  feature. We will cover  vectors  and game development  mathematics  in a full math section to prepare you for gameplay programming before diving in and creating our first C++ class. We will then learn Unreal Engine's class hierarchy, creating a basic  Actor , learning about trigonometry as we use the  sine  function to give our items floating behavior. We then create a Bird using the  Pawn  class so we can fly around our level and get a literal bird's-eye view. We then create our  Character  class, using  Echo  from the Valley of the Ancient Epic-released free project, a beautiful and lifelike humanoid with  cloth physics  on her scarf and garments. We implement  weapon equipping  and  combat . We learn how to calculate  directional hit reactions , using  root motion animations  to make our enemies stumble in the correct direction based on the direction of impact. We give our enemies  patrolling  behavior, then chasing and  attacking  behavior. We make our enemies smarter with the use of UE5's new  Motion Warping  system, warping our enemy's location and rotation to make it hit the target more frequently, and making it harder to move out of harm's way. We then give Echo a fighting chance, by implementing a  dodge  ability, similar to Dark Souls and Elden Ring. She can dodge out of the way while the enemy swings fervently, making them miss so we can move in to counter-attack. We make  breakable pots and vases  using the  Chaos destruction system , and these breakables  spawn treasure  when we break them, allowing us to collect loot and increment our  gold  count in the HUD. We create a beautiful Soul effect in  Niagara , and make enemies  spawn souls  upon death so we can gain  experience points . We learn how to make enemies stronger with an  Attribute  component, giving them varying levels of  health  and  damage , and  soul spawn counts . We use UE5's new  Animation Blueprint Templates  to reuse all of our enemy code to create different types of enemies, from humanoids that wield weapons to creatures that bite, sting, and smash.

https://www.udemy.com/course/mindfulness-stress-reduction/,Learn Mindfulness Meditation for a Calmer and Clearer mind,Practical mindfulness meditation course showing the method how to increase concentration and reduce stress,"Hi, I am Per Norrgren, welcome to my mindfulness course.     	       I first discovered mindfulness some seven years ago when attending an 8 week mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) course — and it changed my life so much that since then teaching mindfulness is my passion and a major part of my life.    I'd love to share with you the peace and the benefits that living mindfully can bring to your life.     	     Whilst teaching mindfulness in the traditional group setting, I have received request to provide the course in eLearning format so even if you can not make it to a group course, you can still learn mindfulness.    To this end, I created (what I think is) probably the most comprehensive eLearning course on Mindfulness you will find. I have included all my material from the traditional course and added specific audio teachings that goes well for eLearning. NOTE! The videos and text material is optional and there if you would like to know more.  The key is to do the audio tracks.   The key is to understand how mindfulness works, what happens in the mind and what to expect, then to experience the change under guidance for your self.  This removes the mystic of the guru, stops you aimlessly wonder and ponder if you do it right and also answers the questions that inevitably pops up.     	       This course is unique in that it includes forty individual audio tracks (divided into 8 weekly sections) where the teachings are embedded in the meditation experience. I have included a short video for each section to give you an overview of what the session aims to achieve. Start each section by watching the video.       	       Each section also has a short handout based on the well-known 8-week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme. These are my own notes, thoughts and experiences collected over the years from books, lectures, international conferences, retreats and training courses. They are there to support you with additional information if you are keen to learn more about how it works.  Note, they are from the actual 8 week MBSR course and therefore contain a weekly home work section etc.      	       This course is designed to make it easy to learn and to practice at the same time. Becoming mindful can be straightforward but most people find they need external guidance to practice effectively when they first start out. This programme provides everything you need to make your mindfulness journey as effortless as possible. It is  structured as easy-to-follow audio tracks, each being ten minutes long. You have five audio tracks per week and I want you to listen to each track twice on the same day. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon/evening. You can of course listen more often if you would like.       	       The full programme is intended to run over eight weeks. This is important. You cannot rush mindfulness. The parts of the brain you are exercising and ""re-wiring"" are very old and science has shown that it takes daily practice to create a permanent change to your automatic reactions. You can repeat weeks if you like and take longer than eight weeks if you need to - the important thing is to keep practicing each day.       	       I teach from my own personal experience, sharing what I have learned and how I conquered my inner fear, anxiety, stress and burnout. What you learn on this course is permanent, grounded in real life experience and science, and it is very likely that it will change your life.     In doing this course, not only does it help my clients to deal with the stress in this moment, they are also maximising their chances of maintaining good mental health throughout their lives.   Wishing you a wonderful course   in peace   Per Norrgren inMindSight - The Algarve Center for Mindfulness Research and Practice",Free,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/digital-body-language/,Digital Body Language,"You will learn what your digital brand says about you through your social media pictures, website and more.","Do you have a digital brand?   If you have ever posted anything online then the answer is YES!   Whether you have a booming personal website or a simple LinkedIn page… Whether you write your own blog or have a basic online dating profile… Whether you like it or not…   …you have a digital brand.   I want to show you how to optimize it. I did not realize the importance of online personal brands until a few things happened all at once. Let me share three stories so you can understand why digital brands are so important:   Story #1:   Last spring I met a guy named Dave at a friend’s party. My friend introduced us and said something like, “Dave, meet Vanessa. Vanessa, meet Dave. He is single and looking for a great girl. He is amazing and you have to hook him up with someone you know!” I have a personal passion for matchmaking, so I was very excited to meet Dave and set him up. After a few minutes, I was convinced that there was some giant misunderstanding. This guy was GREAT–how could he be single?! He said he had been online dating to meet people and just couldn’t get any dates. I asked him to pull up his profile so I could take a look and…wow. His profile was super sleazy–totally opposite of the guy standing in front of me! The pictures were misleading, his little intro video came across as super inauthentic and I immediately knew why he wasn’t getting dates.  He had a lot to offer, but had an easy-to-fix Digital Branding Problem.   Story #2:   Here at the Science of People, we often help entrepreneurs with their pitches–especially if they are trying to raise venture capital money or speaking at conferences. One female entrepreneur in particular was trying to raise money for a Kickstarter campaign. She had a great product that could help a lot of people. She had begun taking sales on her website and launched a Kickstarter campaign last April. The problem: No one was buying. She contacted us to look at her website, video and Kickstarter page. Before looking at her online assets I got to read about her amazing product in an email. When I finally clicked over to her website and campaign, I was shocked. Although her idea was great, her website, sales page and Kickstarter video left A LOT to be desired. No wonder she wasn’t getting sales. She had a great business but a  huge Digital Branding Problem.   Story #3:   A few weeks later, I attended a tech conference, and I heard a BRILLIANT programmer speak on a panel. During his short 30 minute panel he absolutely stole the stage from the other particpants. He shared some of the tools and web applications he has developed and blew everyone in the audience away. During Q&A everyone was directing questions towards him and afterwards he had a line of 10 people dying to talk to him. I happened to be sitting next to a Vice President of a major sports brand in the audience. She turned to me at one point and said, “I would do anything to get this guy on our tech team. I wonder if he would consider switching jobs?” I suggested she try Google searching him to see if she could get his email. A few minutes later she turned her laptop towards me with a horrified look. She pointed at his personal website and said, “I can’t believe this is the same guy! He clearly does brilliant work for his companies, but hasn’t applied any of it to his own stuff.” His personal website was barren, sterile and disorganized.  Very  unlike the person we were seeing on stage. The VP told me that his website was a deal breaker, saying something like, “We want people who are above average in all areas of their brand. His brand rubs off on us too.”  He had a misleading Digital Branding Problem.   What do these stories tell us? There are myths about digital branding:   Myth:  If I don’t own a business, I don’t need to worry about my personal brand. Myth:  A Facebook page doesn’t count as a digital brand. Myth:  My business model speaks for itself. I don’t need to worry about online positioning. Myth:  What I say on my profile or website is more important than the visual cues.   Let’s Stop the Madness!   It drives me crazy when talented, wonderful, awesome people forget about their online assets.   A bad digital first impression can destroy your chances at a job, on a date or in a relationship.   You have 0.05 seconds to make a good first impression online. In those 50 milliseconds you have to hook someone and convey who you are, why they should connect with you AND build trust. You may realize it, but in the digital age, often times your first impression happens even before you meet someone. The problem is, you often focus on the verbal content of your profiles and websites. But since your digital first impression happens so quickly–before someone reads any of your content or descriptions, you have to capture their attention with nonverbal cues or your digital body language.   If you have no idea what your digital first impression is, let alone how to fix it…   I’m here to help!",Free,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/security-601-exams/,CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) Practice Exams & Simulated PBQs,Full-length CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) Practice Exams * Simulated PBQs * Timed * 480 Questions with feedback!,"All questions are based on the Exam Objectives for the SY0-601 exam for all 5 domains of the exam, so you can take and pass the actual CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) certification exam with confidence!  In this course, I fully prepare you for what it is like to take the CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) certification exam. These 6 full-length practice exams with 80 questions (including simulation-style questions or PBQs as CompTIA calls them) are timed for 90 minutes to help you pace yourself for the real exam. I have carefully hand-crafted each question to put you to the test and prepare you to pass the certification exam with confidence. You won't be hoping you are ready, you will know you are ready to sit for and pass the exam. After practicing these tests and scoring an 90% or higher on them, you will be ready to PASS on the first attempt and  avoid costly re-schedule fees , saving you time and money. You will receive your total final score, along with feedback on each and every question, telling you exactly why each answer is correct, and which domain (and objective) you need to study more in order to pinpoint the areas in which you need to improve and perform some additional study.  We cover  all five domains of the SYO-601  exam, including: 1.0 Attacks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities (24%) 2.0 Architecture and Design (21%) 3.0 Implementation (25%) 4.0 Operations and Incident Response (16%) 5.0 Governance, Risk, and Compliance (14%) Our CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) practice exams provide you with realistic test questions and provide you with interactive, question-level feedback.  I have some of the  highest-rated CompTIA training courses on the Udemy platform  and I invite you to visit my instructor profile to learn more about me, the certifications that I hold, and read the reviews of my courses. This course is consistently updated to ensure it stays current and up-to-date with the latest release of the CompTIA Security+ exam, and also provide a 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked! What others are saying about my CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601): Practice Exams with Simulations course:  These questions are unique and well-conducted to prepare for security+ with relevant information. I am using multiple resources and this is definitely one to have. (Valdrin, 5 stars) I passed and these practice tests were a very important tool in my success. The details: the questions in these practice tests require very careful reading. For me, that was key as the actual exam's questions were more concise, so I felt well-prepared. To use these practice exams effectively (at least for me), I recommend taking the first one, determine what areas are the weak and emphasize your study in those areas for a number of days. Then take the next test and see what progress - or lack of - and then the study again. Repeat this until you complete all six. Then start the process again. If you have hit your study targets consistently, you should be able to get to 90% and above on the next or subsequent round of sample exams. I found that I was easily getting above 90% on my last week of studying before my exam. I did find the simulated questions to be inadequate, however. You may need to find an additional source for performance-based questions to supplement what you are learning here with the multiple choice questions. Don't overlook the PBQs! They were a challenge on the exam but I prepared well outside of Dion's tests and I think that's what allowed me to pass (honestly, who knows; there isn't any detailed feedback when the results are displayed and I don't know how much the PBQs are weighted in the total point calculation). Good luck! (Edward Valizan, 5 stars) Another quality piece from Jason Dion. Honestly, if you want to pass any CompTIA exams, just buy Jason's practice exams. I have just bought the CySA+ practice exams, I am sure I will pass for the first time. Edit: I see a lot of people are complaining that it is not like the real exam questions and it does not cover all the topics. Of course you use other training materials too. I have read the Chaplle-Seidl book by Sybex. I have done all the online tests included with the book. I had the official CompTIA notes as well. I have watched a full video course from a wrong source it was so boring and dry, it was just a waste of my time. All in all, to me these tests covered all the topics I did not cover from the other materials, they are difficult but similarly worded than the exam, so your brain is trained for the real exam. I did not have time to go thorugh them 3 times so I have never done 90% on any of them, still passed the Sec+ exam easy. Anyways if you want to go down that route and want the real exam questions; exam dumps are readily available for free after some googling. Unfortunately, I don't see the point of that.  (Gabe Laszlo, 5 stars) Upon completion of this course, you will earn 6 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.",€94.99,en_US

It's creative. It gives you a huge self-satisfaction when you look at your work and say,  ""I made this!"" . I love that feeling after I'm done working on something. When I lean back in my chair, look at the final result with a smile, and have this little  ""spark joy""  moment. It's especially satisfying when I know  I just made $5,000 . Wouldn't you want to have that? Wouldn't you want to be  your own boss ? Working  2-3 hours per day  and making more than what people make working full-time? Waking up whenever  you want? Working from home? Or Starbucks? Or bathtub? If that's your thing. Or from some awesome place like Bali? I do!  And that's why I got into this field. Not for the love of Web Design, which I do now. But for the  LIFESTYLE! There are many ways one can achieve this lifestyle. This is my way.  This is how I achieved a lifestyle  I've been fantasizing about for five years. And I'm going to teach you the same. Often people think Web Design is complicated. That it needs some creative talent or knack for computers. Sure, a lot of people make it very complicated. People make the simplest things complicated. Like most subjects taught in the universities. But I don't like complicated.  I like easy . I like life hacks. I like to take the shortest and simplest route to my destination. I haven't gone to an art school or have a computer science degree.  I'm an outsider to this field  who hacked himself into it, somehow ending up being a sought-after professional. That's how I'm going to teach you Web Design. So you're not demotivated on your way with needless complexity. So you enjoy the process because it's simple and fun. So you can  become a Freelance Web Designer in no time . For example, this is a Design course but I don't teach you Photoshop.  Because Photoshop is needlessly complicated  for Web Design. But people still teach it to web designers. I don't. I teach  Figma  – a simple tool that is taking over the design world. You will be designing a complete website within a week while others are still learning how to create basic layouts in Photoshop. Second , this is a Development course. But I don't teach you how to code. Because for Web Design coding is needlessly complicated and takes too long to learn. Instead, I teach  Webflow  – a tool that is taking over the web design world. You will be building complex websites within two weeks while others are still learning the basics of HTML & CSS. Third , this is a Freelancing course. But I don't just teach you how to write great proposals. I give you a winning proposal template. When you're done with the course, you will have a stunning portfolio website with portfolio pieces already in it. Buy this course now  and take it  whenever the time is right  for you.",€119.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/salesforce-administrator/,The Complete Salesforce Certified Administrator Course,225 New Lessons Added! Includes Practice Test and ChatGPT Prompt Library - Most In-Depth and Current Admin Course Here!,"140 NEW Video Lessons Added April, 2023 and 85 NEW Video Lesson Added May, 2023! Other instructors just update their course title or subtitle with the current month...every month, but don't actually update their courses.  Don't believe me? Just check their courses at the beginning of each month. The only updates they make are to the title and subtitle. Many of the instructors here are also my former students. Do you want to entrust your Salesforce career to someone with minimal experience and makes that their main selling point of their course...how little experience they had when they passed the exam just a year or two ago? Don't be fooled. The amount of information and concepts that you need to understand in order to pass the Administrator exam is massive. This course is the most in-depth and complete course you'll find and I encourage you to not settle for a lightweight course that glosses over or entirely skips key concepts that you need to know. There are no shortcuts or magic bullets, so don't be fooled by someone selling you a happy/easy path. You are on the correct course right now and here you will learn all that you need and be well thoroughly equipped for the exam. I also do not hold down a 'day job' but work daily in the platform to stay up to date and to teach you the latest on the platform. Those with a day job simply don't have the time to devote to keep their courses current and especially don't have the time or interest to go very in-depth. That's why they make the shallowness of their courses the main selling point. Also, there is a better way to learn Salesforce now. And that better way is leveraging the power of ChatGPT to deepen and broaden your Salesforce learning and understanding. I am the only Salesforce instructor teaching how to use ChatGPT to prepare for certification exams. The reason this is is because ChatGPT makes many certification prep and resume/job sites and services OBSOLETE.  You can now create your own practice test questions, study guides, flash cards, and even get massive help on your resumes and interview prep, LinkedIn presence and more, for free, with ChatGPT. Rather than trying to hide this new reality from you, I am embracing this revolutionary technology to take your learning and potential earning to the next level. That is why I recorded a brand new and updated version of this course to leverage the power of ChatGPT to help you prepare for and pass the Salesforce Certified Administrator Exam in record time! It would have been much easier for me to leave my well-established, top-selling and top-ranking admin course alone and just update the title and subtitle like other instructors, but I care too much about your success to rest. So I opted to record the additional 225+ videos of close to 20 hours of additional video content to make this course as up to date as possible.  This course includes a ChatGPT Prompt Library. You can copy and paste all of the prompts I use inside this course into your own free ChatGPT account. This ChatGPT Prompt Library will help you to learn the now in-demand skills for Prompt Engineering and Design! With the power of ChatGPT you can now do amazing things such as creating apex code to mass update records, create formula fields, validation rules, and so much more. You will now find new knowledge area sections in the front of this course where I use ChatGPT to show you how to create Practice Tests, Study Guides, Flashcards and many more study aids. I have worked on the Salesforce platform for over a decade. I have helped hundreds of thousands of students attain one or multiple Salesforce certifications. I have been teaching on the Udemy platform since 2016 and this is my fourth full revamp of this course. I continually work in the latest Salesforce release to remain current and am constantly updating this course. In addition to 500+ in-depth video lessons inside this course, you will also find a Practice Test at the end of this course. It contains 60 questions, and is timed at 90 minutes. You receive Section Level Feedback, just like in the real test. I provide further details and explanations as to why your answers are either correct or incorrect. Did you know that Salesforce is the 5th most in-demand IT skill on job postings worldwide? Now is a great time to learn Salesforce and change your career to the cloud.  This course is constantly updated to be current with the latest release of Salesforce. ""I'm at (Salesforce's) Destination Success right now and your course goes more in-depth than the classroom courses here, and for 1% of the cost!"" - Ben L. This Salesforce Certification Course and Instructor were recently featured in InfoWorld!  The Complete Salesforce Administrator Certification Course is for anyone interested in passing the Administrator Certification exam. This course is designed with the new Salesforce administrator in mind. I cover each section of the Administrator Study Guide in-depth, giving examples in the interface, as well as hands-on experience so you  can apply the concepts you are learning. After 60,000+  Survey ratings for my courses, the students have spoken: ""Are you learning valuable information?"" 99.6% answered YES ""Are the explanations of the concepts clear?"" 99.8% answered YES ""Is the instructor knowledgeable about the topic?"" 99.9% answered YES If you are interested in becoming a Salesforce Admin, take this course. Here are some recent reviews and feedback this course has received: ""Mike, your course was great! I took the Admin Essentials class by Salesforce in which my company paid over 2000 dollars for in person live training and the training did not come close to anything on the exam. Your course helped me to get properly prepped and covered all the pertinent aspects of the 201 exam in which I passed."" ~ Harris L. ""Very well presented, excellent video quality, incredibly easy to follow. Covers more than what is necessary (not a criticism), Creator is a legend, I've contacted him multiple times and had a response within 5 minutes. Could not rate any higher ! Definitely the best choice out of the courses offered for this qualification. Amazing."" ~ Paul R. ""I'm amazed that a training program of such great quality is available for such a reasonable price! Mike is a wonderful trainer and the material covered is excellent!"" ~ Rick A. "" Mike is awesome and learning so much so far! Mike thanks so much for the really awesome course! I am sure that when I take the admin exam soon that I will pass with flying colors!!"" ~ James W. ""This is the best course so far. Thank you for your video."" ~ Christian M.

From challenges with data replication to confusing unordered event streams,  every major challenge of building microservices is covered.    Beyond focusing on the basics of microservices, this course is a perfect introduction to the world of  full-stack development .  You will work all the way from the frontend, assembling a  React app using Hooks , to the backend, including database design and deployment strategies.  Every step along the way is covered in tremendous detail, with ample diagrams to ensure every step is crystal clear. Many other resources show only the easiest, simplest apps written with microservices.  This course does the opposite:  we focus on the most challenging aspects of microservices , challenges that you will likely encounter  every single day.   You will see these difficulties first hand, then  solve them with easy-to-understand strategies. ------------------- How This Course Works This course doesn't focus on using an off-the-shelf microservices framework. Many exist, but they hide the inner workings and challenges of microservices away from you. Instead, we will be using a  minimal number of libraries , and write as much custom code as possible. This will expose you to challenging problems and clever solutions when handling subjects like async events! What Technology You'll Use Because we are building a full stack application, we will use a variety of technologies. On the frontend, we'll use  React  and  Next JS  to present content to users. Each service is created using  Node  and  Express . Data for each service is held in either a  Mongo  database or  Redis . The entire app is deployed and runs in  Docker  containers executed in a  Kubernetes  cluster. Finally, almost all of the code in this course is written with  Typescript . This is a scary list of technologies!  Not familiar with some of these? No problem!  The course is built assuming that you  only  know the basics of Javascript and Express.  No other knowledge is needed  - you will learn everything you need to know. What You'll Be Able to Do By the time you complete this course, you will be able to: Architect  a multi-service application Determine whether your app is a good fit for a microservices approach Understand and  solve the challenges  in async, event-based communication between services Use Docker and Kubernetes to  deploy a multi-service app to any cloud provider Organize and enhance the  reusability of code  in large projects What You'll Learn An absolute incredible number of topics are covered in this course.  Here is a  partial  list of what you'll do: Practice  patterns to create scalable microservices  for a variety of app domains Build a  Server-Side-Rendered React  app using Hooks and Next JS Write a custom implementation of an  event bus Optionally, run a  development environment through a cloud provider Guarantee  consistently structured responses  from your different API's See  best practices  in communication between different services Configure and scale your services using  Kubernetes Deployments Document and enforce  structure constraints  on events shared across microservices Limit access to your APIs using  JWT-based authentication And much more! This is the course I wish I had when I was learning microservices. A course that focuses on the hardest parts, gives clear explanations, and discusses the pros and cons of different design options.

However, given that many companies are implementing Work From Home (WFH) policies in the wake of COVID-19, I thought it would be useful to share with a wider audience. While you may hear references that are internal to Udemy, I hope you find some useful tips to use as you work from home! Do you find yourself losing productivity when you work remotely? Do you have trouble maintaining a normal workday with all the distractions of your home?   If so, you're not alone. Many employees find that they are not set up for success when they work from home. Working remotely is not simply working from a new location. You can't just take your laptop home and expect to work in exactly the same way as you normally do. There are  many  differences between an office that's built for work and a home that's typically not set up for working productively.  I had to work from home for 3 years while employed at a small startup. It was my first time doing so, and I had to quickly learn and adapt my living space so I could successfully complete my job. Over those years, I collected many tips and tricks for how to best work remotely. These are simple things that you can implement right now that will make a big difference when you work from home! In this course, I'll cover: Ways to communicate to stay accountable (and social!) with your colleagues Best practices for running meetings virtually Suggestions for accountability and productivity when working from home Ideas for structuring and planning your day and workspace for optimal results Quick tips for managers leading teams in a remote world If you want a QUICK & EASY primer on working remotely, please join me in this course!",Free,en_US

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look.

JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input. Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.

Highly recommend this training. I am a Lead ERP Financial Systems Analyst who worked mostly with Oracle BI tools. Company wants to go in a different direction so I am learning Power BI.

In this course, learn the skills that Microsoft want you to know, and add another tool to your CV, and even go for the Microsoft Power BI certification. Power BI is one of the most requested reporting tools that are requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to use it now could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt. This course comes in four parts: Part 1 - Creating Visualizations (also known as Visualize the Data, and Analyze the Data) We'll download and install for free Power BI Desktop. We'll start by creating our first visualizations (vizzes) and investigate the Power BI interface. We'll look at the various visualisations available, and go through their common properties. We'll create maps, hierarchies, KPIs, guages, and all sorts of chart types.  Part 2 - Get and Transform Data (also known as Prepare the Data) We see how data can be transformed, saving you time in analysing the data. We'll look at sorting and filtering, split columns, and other transform activities. We'll merge, append and combine queries together. We'll Pivot and Unpivot, and transform text, numbers, dates and times, and create custom columns using the M language. Part 3 - Refining the model (also known as Model the Data) We'll see how relationships can be made through multiple tables, and refine the data with custom columns and measures using the DAX language. Part 4 - Power BI Service We'll then publish our visualisations onto the Power BI Service (which you can sign up for free), and then from your reports create dashboards. With the Power BI Pro (for which you can get a free trial), you can also create workspaces and apps. The course will take around 28 hours to complete, but completing this will enable you to create vizzes, dashboards and stories of your own, and know how to overcome common problems. The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll create for instance a table or basic bar chart, then turn it into a stacked bar chart, and investigate more of their properties, step by step. The course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual analysis will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on. At the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, and be able to start creating analyses for yourselves. And with a bit of practice, you could also go for the official Microsoft PL-300 exam - wouldn’t that certificate look good on your CV or resume?",€139.99,en_US

This course comes with  two paths  which you can take: The  ""complete"" path  (full >20h course) and the  ""summary"" path  (~3h summary module) - you can choose the path that best fits your time requirements! --- I created the  bestselling Udemy course on React , now I'm super excited to share this course on NextJS with you - an  in-depth course  about an amazing React framework that allows you to  take the next step as a React developer  and build real, production-ready projects with React and Next.js! Next.js  is the  production-ready ,  fullstack-capable  framework for  ReactJS  - the  most popular JavaScript library  you can learn these days! Too many buzzwords for your taste? Fair enough - but indeed, NextJS is a great choice for  growing as a React developer  and for  taking your React apps to the next level ! Because  NextJS is growing fast and therefore in high demand.  And there are good reasons for that: NextJS allows you to build React apps with  built-in server-side rendering  and  page pre-rendering . Building great user experiences and search engine friendly (SEO!) React apps has never been easier! In addition, NextJS makes building  fullstack React apps  (frontend + backend code combined in one project) extremely easy as well! Blend client-side and server-side code and build a NodeJS-based API side-by-side with your frontend React apps. It's a breeze with NextJS! Want to add  authentication ? NextJS simplifies that as well and makes user signup, sign in and session management very convenient. This course will take you from NextJS beginner to advanced level in no time! We'll start at the very basics, no NextJS knowledge is required at all, and we'll then dive into all the core features that make up NextJS. Both in theory as well as with  multiple real projects  where all concepts will be applied step-by-step. For this course, you'll need  basic React knowledge , though the course does come with a  ""React refresher"" module  in case it's been some time since you last worked with React. This course also includes a  ""NextJS Summary"" module  which allows you to always come back to the course in the future and refresh your knowledge without going through the full course again. Or you just take that summary module (and skip the rest for now) to learn about all the core features in as little time as possible. After finishing this course, you'll be well prepared to build your own NextJS projects from the ground up and apply for NextJS positions! In detail, this course will cover: What is NextJS? And why would you use it? Why is just React (in many cases) not enough? Creating NextJS projects from the ground up & understanding these projects Working with file-based routing Adding dynamic routes and catch-all routes Implementing different forms of page pre-rendering and server-side rendering Working with data and adding data fetching + pre-fetching to your apps Pre-generating dynamic and static pages Adding optimizations like metadata to pages Optimizing images with the NextJS Image component Building fullstack apps with API routes Managing app-wide state with React context (in NextJS apps) Adding authentication to NextJS apps Multiple complete apps where we'll apply all these core concepts! A complete React.js refresher module (so that we're all on the same page) A NextJS summary module so that you can refresh what you learned or just explore the core features quickly And much more!

Build a massive E-commerce app with Redux, Hooks, GraphQL, Stripe, Firebase","Just FULLY updated and re-recorded with all new React features for 2023 (React v18)! Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by industry experts that have actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto with React.js.   Using the latest version of React  (React 18) , this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore.  Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies. We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on React. This project based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of a React developer in 2023. Along the way, we will build a massive e-commerce application similar to Shopify using React, Redux, React Hooks, React Suspense, React Router, GraphQL, Context API, Firebase, Redux-Saga, Stripe + more. This is going to be a full stack app (MERN stack), using Firebase. The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of releasing a professional React project all the way into production. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you React Basics and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions on architecture and tools on any of your future ReactJS projects.  All code is going to be provided step by step and even if you don’t like to code along, you will get access to the the full master project code so anyone signed up for the course will have their own project to put on their portfolio right away. The topics covered will be: - React Basics - React Router - Redux - Redux Saga - Asynchronous Redux - React Hooks - Context API - React Suspense + React Lazy - Firebase - Stripe API - Styled-Components - GraphQL - Apollo - PWAs - React Performance - React Design Patterns - Testing with Jest and Snapshot testing - React Best Practices - Persistance + Session Storage - State Normalization + more Wait wait… I know what you’re thinking. Why aren’t we building 10+ projects? Well, here’s the truth: Most courses teach you React and do just that. They show you how to get started, build 10 projects that are simple and easy to build in a day, and just add some CSS to make them look fancy. In real life though, you’re not building silly applications. When you apply to jobs, nobody is going to care that you built a really pretty To Do app. Employers want to see you build large apps that can scale, that have good architecture, and that can be deployed to production. Let me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other React tutorial online: 1 . You will build the biggest project you will see in any course. This type of project would take you months to implement yourself. 2.  This course is taught by 2 instructors that have actually worked for some of the biggest tech firms using React in production. Yihua has been working on some of the biggest e-commerce websites that you have definitely heard of and probably have shopped at. Andrei has worked on enterprise level React applications for large IPOed tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto. By having both of them teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 senior developers as if you are working at a company together. 3.  We learn principles that are important beyond just what you learn as a beginner. Using the instructor's experiences you learn about design patterns, how to architect your app, organize your code, structure your folders, and how to think about performance. Let’s just say we don’t shy away from the advanced topics. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No!  This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in React to someone that is in the top 10% of React developers.  Taught By: Andrei Neagoie is the instructor of the  highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.  His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.  Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.  Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.    Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.  Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.  He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.   Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.    See you inside the courses! -------- Yihua Zhang is one of the Instructors of Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing Web Development academies on Udemy . He has been working as a software developer for numerous years in Toronto for some of the largest tech companies in the world. He has also been working as an instructor for more than a decade. He is focused on bringing everything he has learned to help you achieve a new career as a developer, but also give you all the fundamental skills required to flourish in this incredible industry. Yihua is a self taught developer, so he fully understands the challenges and mindset of coming into this industry from various other backgrounds. He has been on both sides of the table, as both an instructor and student numerous times so he can empathize with the difficulty of learning something new and challenging.

AWS is always updating its exam content, and thus, the exam dumps you are seeing over the Internet are mostly inaccurate and outright illegal. The provided answers are wrong, and you are not provided with the proper explanations as to why an option is correct or not. We write our own practice exam content based on the official SAA-C03 Exam Guide and on our own AWS exam experience. If you are looking for exam dumps for the SAA-C03 exam, please look somewhere else because this course is definitely NOT for you.  The  AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate  is consistently among the top-paying IT certifications, considering that  Amazon Web Services  (AWS) is the leading cloud services platform in the world with almost 50% market share! Earn over $150,000 per year with an AWS Solutions Architect certification! But before you become an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional, it is recommended for you to pass the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification exam first, and this is where AWS practice tests come in. It is possible that you have read all of the available AWS documentation online yet still fail the exam! These AWS practice tests simulate the actual certification exam and ensure that you indeed understand the subject matter.  This  AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C03 ) Practice Exam  course offers the following features: FULLY UPDATED TO THE  SAA-C03 version -  Most practice tests out there are already obsolete and advertised as ""updated"", but in reality, they are not! We have already integrated the new SAA-C03 topics such as Amazon Detective, AWS Global Accelerator, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon EKS Anywhere, AWS Proton, and many more in our sets. The content of this practice test will also be updated to reflect the new SAA-C03 topics. 390 TOP-NOTCH Questions  - has 6 sets of AWS Practice Tests with 65 UNIQUE questions and a 130-minute time limit for each set.

CONTAINS A TEST REPORT  - to track your progress and show you which AWS knowledge areas you need improvement. MOBILE-COMPATIBLE  - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone! RANDOMIZED QUESTIONS  - The scenarios and options on all 6 practice tests are randomized. This prevents the unconscious memorization of the answers and ensures that you fully understand the concepts. CLEAR AND ERROR-FREE QUESTIONS  - Each item has reference links to the official AWS Documentation that can validate our provided answer, but you can also post in the QA section so we can discuss any issues. Prepared by an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional  who has actually passed the actual SAA-C03 exam! (Please see my LinkedIn profile to view my AWS Certificate) These practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam topics (such as EC2, EBS, S3, and many others) hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other AWS knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic is carefully selected based on the 4 domains of the actual AWS certification exam. Some people are using brain dumps or exam dumps for the  AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate   SAA-C03  certification exam, which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because those exam dumps will hinder you from attaining in-depth AWS knowledge. It can also result in you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage. Please also note that these  AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate practice tests   SAA-C03  are not exam dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with hundreds to thousands of questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03   practice tests are meant to do. When I was reviewing for my  AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate  exam, I had a hard time finding comprehensive practice tests to help me pass my exam. I bought some of them in the market, but I was disappointed because there were a lot of technical and grammatical errors in the practice questions. This is why I created these AWS practice tests to help my fellow IT professionals in the industry.  We gave a considerable amount of effort to creating and publishing these AWS practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your SAA-C03 exam. And we don't need to trash or slander other AWS practice test courses here on Udemy just to make a sale because we are confident that our AWS practice tests are simply the  BEST . IMPORTANT NOTE   These AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams for the new SAA-C03 version have a passing score of 72%, but I highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.  Remember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the AWS exam, as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these Amazon Web Services practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment of which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score! AWS always updates the content of their AWS Certification exam. This is why we regularly update the content of this practice tests reviewer to be on par with the new SAA-C03 version.",€29.99,en_US

I have taken many online courses and have never seen this level of commitment to students and to keeping the content up to date and relevant. And your courses are great too! Just know that what you are doing is appreciated. Many thanks, Jan Beasley"" About the Course This course will guide you through every single step from installation to finished website.  I'll show you how you can install Wordpress on your own computer for free, so you don't have to pay for a domain name or hosting fees while you complete this course.  Once you've got Wordpress installed on your computer, you will learn how to build and run a successful, beautiful, responsive-design website you can be proud of.  After taking you through all of the main options in Wordpress, explaining what each one does and how you set it up, I'll let you  watch over my shoulder  as I build a Wordpress website.  It will be an affiliate site that I hope will make me passive income for many years to come.  Go and check out the free preview tutorials in Section 13.     Who is this Wordpress course for?   Have you ever wanted to build a professional looking website, but didn't know where to start?  Now you can.  Wordpress for Beginners is a complete course for anyone, no matter what your technical ability.  This course assumes no prior knowledge!   At the start of the course, I'll walk you through setting up Wordpress on your own computer so that you don't need to pay for a web host (or a domain name) while you master wordpress.  When you decide you want to put a website online, you can then watch over-my-shoulder as I buy a domain name and hosting, and install Wordpress online.

Everything is very clearly explained, and Andy promptly answers any question you might have. If you are interested in using and learning WordPress, you owe it to yourself to take this outstanding course.   Robert Weiser Lectures are well-structured with lots of details given. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and communicates very effectively. I've been able to set up my first website based on what I've learned here. A definite plus is that questions posted via the course are answered quickly!   Susan Worms I love this course. I have spent a few hours today and I have already learned so much. Really excited about the potential for when I am done. Great Course!  A. Luis Acosta I learned a lot more than how to use WordPress in basic terms. Andrew shares a lot of insider knowledge and tips that would take you countless hours of doing your own research to learn...and answering questions you may not have thought to ask. Couldn't have asked for a better course to help me jumpstart into WordPress.  Nathaniel Stephens What a fantastic share of knowledge. I really appreciated and loved how a ""real"" site was used for the lectures, real world examples of everything. I would definitely take this course - highly recommended!  Glen Schafer This course is perfect for people who want to start a blog or info page with wordpress. He covers all the basics and sometimes goes even a little deeper, to give you an idea what to look for. The provided documents are gold and very helpfull. I can't wait to go public with my site. Thank you for the great lectures .  Andreas Lackmann I really wish I had access to a course such as this four years ago when I first started dabbling with Wordpress as a hobby in my retirement. The learning process at the time, for a non-techy like me, was painstaking. Andy's course was the ideal step-by-step teaching method. I'm now much more confident about starting a new affiliate marketing website.  Leon Well delivered, well structured. Easy to follow and logical. Developed my own website in parallel with the course, and had it up and running within two weeks of starting. Looking forward to undertaking a couple of the course developers other courses now. Highly recommended.  Steve Laing Excellent instructor. Andy is great. He used visuals for everything he say. I was able to pause him and go to my site and test my understanding in all areas that I did know. The results and excitement are fantastic.  Esau Khan A fantastic course. Thank you Andy. This is a great course and it has helped me start to build my own WordPress website. I was very impressed when I had a problem with viewing my site that you took time to check for me. That shows what a great teacher you are. I have booked up another course by to and can't wait for more. Once again. Thank you.  B Brown Many of the courses I've been through related to learning Wordpress are either too complicated or the author doesn't spend enough time explaining concepts so that you can understand what's being said. Andy strikes a nice balance with this course in that all the modules are broken up into easily digestible pieces. I like that he takes enough time to explain each new concept or module without being repetitive or using jargon that's difficult to follow. I also love being able to follow along with Andy as he explains each new module as well (as opposed to just talking off of slides all the time). He literally walks you through everything, so it's like you're right there looking over his shoulder. For anyone wanting to understand all the fundamentals of Wordpress, I think you'll absolutely love this course. It will save you tons of time by having all this information in one place. And you'll even learn some additional features like setting up affiliate links (not that everyone needs to know this but I like that Andy included it so it's there if you ever want to know). Truly a fantastic course!   Lance Gross Superb Course - Extraordinary Instructor!! Andy's Wordpress for Beginners-Master Wordpress Quicky course is by far the best Wordpress course I've seen. And I definitely wouldn't say it's just for beginners. I'm not a beginner - I thought I knew Wordpress pretty well, but I learned SO MUCH MORE from this course! I've always had a lot of questions about the many settings and various options in Wordpress and most courses just skip over them or tell you to check this box and move on with no explanation. I never really got my questions answered until now. Andy is very detailed in his instruction. He walks you through step by step and tells you what each setting or section is for, how it is used (or not used) and why. I got more out of Andy's course than any other course I've ever taken. He has an extensive teaching background and it is evident in his clearly produced videos. After taking this course, you'll find your confidence level will soar.   Carol",€129.99,en_US

(Cory, 5 stars) These exams really helped with passing the actual cert exam! I personally studied using Certmaster from CompTIA not the specific Dion training course for core 1. The explanations on why a questions answer was right or wrong was wonderful. Sometimes different presentations of information work better when I am learning new topics or trying to remember how everything interconnects. (Ryan Blauser, 5 stars) I had paid for ITProTV for two months, and the video lectures and practices exams were not half as helpful to me as this one set of practice exams. To make matters worse ITProTV did not even teach some of the things that were on these exams meaning I was likely not going to pass the actual certification exam using their videos and practice. This was my most valuable resource used for passing my certification and I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking to use practice exams in their exam prep.

https://www.udemy.com/course/14-day-english-language-fluency-course/,14-day English language fluency course,You will improve your spoken English in just 2 weeks!,"Are you struggling to speak English?     Have you spent hours learning new words, studying grammar, watching English movies, listening to English music and now you wonder why you can’t use all of this knowledge in a conversation?       Well, here’s your answer!       Speaking English is a skill- just like swimming. Can you learn swimming from a book? No. How about from a movie? No, again. You need to get into the pool and start doing the action. Speaking, like swimming, is an action.        So, the ONLY way to improve your spoken English is to speak.       That’s where this course helps you!       How does this course work?     I have divided this course into 14 days. Each day has a new topic and each topic is divided into  4 short videos .       The  first video  will introduce 8 words or terms. In this video I will explain the meaning of these words and provide an example of how it can be used in a sentence. At the end, we will review the vocabulary.       In the  second video  I provide an example speech of the topic. In this video I use the words from video 1 to make a speech. This allows you to see me using the vocabulary.       The  third  video is the most important video. In this video I give you a chance to make a speech using the vocabulary of the topic. But there is one rule:       You can’t say: umm, ahh, enn or any other vocal-filled pause or interjection.       Why?     Well, this is a fluency course. If you always need to stop and think about what to say next, then you’re not speaking fluently. If you do break the rule, simply stop and start your speech again.        The  final video  is a dictation test. Listen to me say the words from the topic and write them down. Then, compare your spelling with the actual spelling of the words.       Can I really improve my spoken English with this course?     I believe you can. I have used this method with literally hundreds of students and have seen my students’ speaking ability improve dramatically.        Why should I choose this course over other courses?     Price.     Firstly, it’s free (for the moment) so you have nothing to lose.       Enthusiastic teacher.     Secondly, I think I teach this course in an enthusiastic way and hope that this enthusiasm spreads to you. I believe that if you want to learn anything, you must be enthusiastic or you will simply give up.        There is a finish line that you can see.     By knowing that this course is only 14 days, I hope that it provides you with the feeling that it is short sprint and not a marathon.         Consistency is key (or king).     It’s much more effective to study a few minutes a day than to study for a few hours once or twice a week. I want English to be your hobby that you enjoy not your habit that you hate. By only studying for a few minutes a day (but doing it every day) it is less likely that you will come to hate learning.        Remember what you learn.     I believe that quality is more important than quantity. My rule as an ESL/EFL teacher is to teach between 5 to 10 words per 1-hour class. This is because how many words you study is not important. Only how many words you can use is the number that we should care about. I see many students trying to remember 30 or even 50 words a day! But, the sad thing is the next day they may only remember 4 or 5. I will teach you vocabulary in a way that allows you to retain the vocabulary that you learn.        Develop a habit for learning.     Finally, many people say that it takes 2 weeks to develop a habit. I hope this course will provide you with the framework to develop a habit of study. While this is my only course (at the moment) here on Udemy, there are many other fantastic courses on here to study. I hope that you can use this course as a stepping stone for your continued growth.         Sign up now and start speaking right away!     So, if you want to learn to speak English more fluently whilst getting your hands on some useful vocabulary, then why not try my 14-day English language fluency course? You have nothing to lose and you will be very glad you did.         Thank you and see you soon,         Joel",Free,en_US

THE must-have JavaScript resource in 2023.,"Join the most comprehensive and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy and learn JavaScript from the ground up, in great detail with this bestselling course! JavaScript is  THE most important programming language  you need to learn as a web developer - and with this course, you make sure that you will not miss a single thing you have to know as a JavaScript developer! This is the  most comprehensive and modern course  you can find on JavaScript - it's  based on all my JavaScript knowledge   AND teaching   experience . It's both a  complete guide , starting with the core basics of the language, as well as an  extensive reference  of the JavaScript language and environment, ensuring that both newcomers as well as experienced JavaScript developers get a lot out of this course! It's a  huge course because it's packed with important knowledge  and helpful content. From the core basics, over advanced concepts and JavaScript specialties, all the way up to expert topics like performance optimization and testing - this course has it all. My goal was to create your go-to resource for the JavaScript language, which you can not just use for learning it but also as a resource you can come back to and look up important topics. The course is based on my experience as a long-term JavaScript developer as well as a teacher with  more than 2,000,000 students  on Udemy as well as on my YouTube channel Academind. It's  packed with examples, demos, projects, assignments, quizzes  and of course videos - all with the goal of giving you the best possible way of learning JavaScript. What's in the course? This course is obviously packed with content - I therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course: Modern JavaScript from the start: The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the  latest syntax from the start  (you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY JS project) ALL the Basics: Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc Arrays & Objects: We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail Control Structures: Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops A look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us Deep dives into Core Concepts : ALL the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes Working with the DOM: How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases) Events in JavaScript: Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag & drop) and execute appropriate code Classes &  Object-oriented Programming : Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the "" this "" keyword, constructor functions and much more Asynchronous  and Synchronous Programming: We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/ await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly Http Requests: Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript Tooling, Optimizations & Browser Support: Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers  - this matters and hence is covered in great detail Libraries & Frameworks: Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like  React.js  - why they matter and how to use them Node.js : Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment Security & Performance Optimizations: Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course! Automated Testing : Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing What are the course prerequisites? NO JavaScript knowledge is required - you'll learn it from scratch! You also need NO programming experience other than basic web development knowledge (e.g. how the web works) Basic HTML and CSS knowledge is recommended but not a must-have",€129.99,en_US
https://www.udemy.com/course/javascriptfundamentals/,JavaScript Fundamentals,Learn JavaScript hands on in quick and easy steps,"This hands on JavaScript training course provides the fundamental knowledge necessary to design and develop dynamic Web pages using JavaScript. It introduces students to client-side JavaScript and how the language can be used to turn static HTML pages into dynamic, interactive Web pages.  JavaScript is the globally used client-side scripting language for the web. Most browsers support the language by default, so you can get started using JavaScript and HTML with a simple text editor and browser for testing. Client-side, programming languages make web pages dynamic without making calls to your web servers for every button clicked, character typed, or mouse moved. The JavaScript language is so popular that thousands of developers have made customised libraries that make development even easier for other programmers and web designers. If you design web pages, you'll certainly need to know JavaScript to make a custom UI (user interface). JavaScript topics include adding JavaScript to a Webpage, use of dialogs to interact with the user and JavaScript intrinsic objects such as Date, Array and Math. Students will also be introduced to the Document Object Model (DOM), creation of functions, event handling, form validation, object creation and more. Create JavaScript Programs Use Variable and Operators Launch Popup Boxes Write conditional and looping logic Create custom functions Handle Events Programmatically Catch and handle errors Learn the basics of debugging Manipulate HTML from JavaScript Use the Browser Object Model Do HTML form validations Create custom JavaScript Objects What are the requirements?

Don't accept imitations! After over 50,000 satisfied students in our original course, Become a SuperLearner® has been updated, upgraded, and improved from the ground up.  This course will teach you how to hack your learning, reading, and memory skills, empowering you to learn anything and everything faster and more effectively.  Whether you're a student, a professional, or simply embarking on a new hobby, you are forced to grapple with an ever-increasing amount of information and knowledge. In fact, it's believed that one week's worth of the New York Times contains more information than people 100 years ago encountered in their entire lives. We've all experienced the frustration of an ever-growing reading list, struggling to learn a new language, or forgetting things you learned in even your favorite subjects.  Anyone can develop SuperLearning skills!  This course is about improving your ability to learn new skills or information  quickly and effectively . We go far beyond the kinds of ""speed-reading"" (or glorified skimming) you may have been exposed to, diving into the  actual cognitive and neurological factors  that make learning easier and more successful. We also give you advanced memory techniques to grapple with the huge loads of information you'll be able to process.  You'll learn how to input and retain information in a whole new way - a faster, better way  The core of this SuperLearning course involves 3 ""Super Skills"":   Speed-reading with high (80%+) comprehension and understanding Memory techniques for storing and recalling vast amounts of information quickly and accurately Developing the cognitive infrastructure to support this flood of new information long-term However, the SuperLearning skills you'll learn in this course are applicable to many aspects of your every day life, from remembering phone numbers to acquiring new skills or even speaking new languages.  How this new course will change your life and triple your learning speed:  The sad irony is that in order to learn most of these superlearning skills and memory techniques in the past, you had to read dozens of books and psychological journals. Or, you had to hire an expensive private tutor who specializes in superlearning. That's what I did. And it changed my life.  Fortunately, my instructors (experts in the fields of superlearning, memory techniques, and speed-reading) agreed to help me transform their materials into the first ever digital course. That course,  Become a SuperLearner™ 1.0,  took the internet by storm, becoming one of the top courses in the history of Udemy, and resulting in a bestselling book and top-ranking podcast.  How is it different from SuperLearner® 1.0? Over the last 2 years and 50,000+ students, we’ve had tens of thousands of data points and pieces of feedback, helping us improve both our methodology and our teaching practices. This new course has more (and better) content than ever before, including: Completely re-written lectures emphasizing clarity and engagement! All-new lectures on topics never before covered! Hands-on demonstration videos for every major concept Dramatically improved video and audio quality Interactive worksheets to print and complete Even MORE supplemental resources! We can confidently say that this is the best, most comprehensive accelerated learning product we’ve ever released on Udemy. The course will require 2-3 hours of memory and speed-reading practice and training per week, and last roughly 7-9 weeks. It won't be easy - but if you put in the work, you are guaranteed to succeed.  In addition to the lectures, there is an additional 1.5 hours of supplemental video content from TED, YouTube, and other sources which are considered part of the course curriculum.

Students also have the option to apply for  free , optional,  extra Lean Six Sigma examination and certification . This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute.  LEAN SIX SIGMA Lean Six Sigma is not a new methodology. It actually has a history that goes back many decades. So what does Lean Six Sigma do? What is the aim? At this point we won’t go into too much detail, but the absolute essential goal of Lean Six Sigma is first of all to reduce waste or non-value adding activities. This saves costs. The second goal is to deliver quality goods or quality service that matches the norms as set by the organization. The aforementioned goals are goals that are relevant for every sector and for that reason we can state that Lean Six Sigma is beneficial in every single sector. There is a hierarchy in Lean Six Sigma that is shown by belt colors. You start as a certified Lean Six Sigma white belt, then you progress to become a certified Lean Six Sigma yellow belt, after which you can continue to become a Lean Six Sigma green bet and a Lean Six Sigma black belt. As you progress from certified Lean Six Sigma white belt to other belts, you gradually increase your Lean Six Sigma skills. These skills are very concrete and quite in demand in the job market. At this point, we do not ask you to take our word for it, but we invite you to actually do a bit of online research and find out for yourself. Please note that unlike some other subjects, Lean Six Sigma does not have a universally agreed upon body of knowledge, or a universally agreed upon training and certification procedure. We are very open about this issue, because it should be known by every prospective Lean Six Sigma student. Make an informed decision by reviewing your (employer’s) Lean Six Sigma needs/expectations and compare that with what various Lean Six Sigma training institutes are offering in terms of training and certification and subsequently choose the training and certification that best meets those needs. OUR LEAN SIX SIGMA GREEN BELT CERTIFICATION COURSE Our Lean Six Sigma green belt training and certification course is going to take you through the entire DMAIC sequence. The DMAIC sequence is the sequence of phases that a Lean Six Sigma project goes through. In each phase of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC, our Lean Six Sigma green belt training and certification course will introduce you to a number of tools that can help you in the phase. As a certified Lean Six Sigma green belt you are expected to play a major role in the execution of Lean Six Sigma projects, so you will be equipped with a lot of Lean Six Sigma tools that ensure that you can be of substantial added value in the Lean Six Sigma project. The tools that you learn range from qualitative ones to quantitative Lean Six Sigma tools. Please note that we have constructed the Lean Six Sigma green belt training and certification course in such that it is accessible to a wide audience. So there is no need for a specific (mathematical) background in terms of previous education. SIX SIGMA ACADEMY AMSTERDAM Six Sigma academy Amsterdam (SSAA) is an initiative of an international group of university lecturers from Holland who have supervised projects at some of the largest organizations in and outside Holland. The aim was to teach what we already taught offline to university students and make that training more affordable, more accessible, more convenient, whilst making sure that it was practical, fun and easy to grasp. You do not need a particular set of mathematics or statistics skills to keep up. This Lean Six Sigma training is going to be very accessible for people from various educational backgrounds. The Dutch BKO accreditation is an academic grade type of accreditation which differs from an accreditation that commercial parties offer to training institutes. This type of accreditation can only be obtained by academics. Although it is a Dutch accreditation, our experience shows that it is extremely well received outside Holland as well because of the academic nature.

Here are some reviews: ""His honesty is on point and his lessons are priceless. More people need to hear this before age 20!!!"" ""I love the honesty and how the presenter doesn't beat around the bush."" ""I really enjoyed Wolfgang Riebe's course. He has great insights, and is very honest about himself and passionate about what he shares, and down-to-earth as well as funny at times. He really cares, and it makes viewers able to relate to him. I recommend the course to anybody who wants to get a better outlook on life and see things a little more positively."" ""Yes Wolfgang was true and right on how he commented about how the world is. I liked how Wolfgang also admits that somethings can frustrate him, in which he was honest. Even the quotations were right and had meaning to them. I did enjoy this course and it was my first time I discovered this man Wolfgang Riebe."" ""Once the videos started, I did not think I would bond with them, but actually some of the tips are pretty good and are common sense really. The short videos on each section are digestible and you can dip in and out of them."" ""I like how the speaker speaks, I mean like speaking in a very positive tone and makes u want to focus more on what is he talking and I like the quotes given for every category."" ABOUT THE COURSE This is not so much a course, but a collection of 20 assorted YouTube videos from my channel about life. As we are all different and everyone enjoys different ways of learning I have taken 10 topics where I personally discuss various topics, followed by the remaining 10 videos with quotations to music, also on various topics. DISCLAIMER: This course is about MY views of life. It is a straight forward, no holds barred, authentic and down to earth. Hence I get it that not everyone will agree with my points of view. A speaker colleague of mine once said that if 51% of people like you, you are on a winning streak. Of all the reviews - over 95% have enjoyed the course and appreciated my frankness. It's not a course for everyone! Why? I believe that with all the political correctness, greed and entitlement today, we need more people to be openly frank and call a 'spade a spade'. Sadly, not everyone likes hearing this! Remember, this is a free course no one is forcing you to watch it! All I'm doing is trying to leave a legacy and make the world a better place. I trust that those of you who decide to watch this course see and realise that I am speaking honestly from the heart and my only desire is to try and help you find meaning within this crazy world we live it.",Free,en_US

(This works  EVEN IF  you’ve tried to sell on Amazon before and failed or have never sold a single thing in your life.)

They tell you to… Work your butt off in school from age  4 - 22+ … Graduate from a "" prestigious""  university with an overpriced degree (which holds less weight than ever before)… Try  to get a job that you think you’ll love but turn out  despising  because you hate the people you work with and don’t seem to have  ANY time  to enjoy what you truly love. Meagerly invest in the stock market so you can retire at age 65 when you have little time and  ZERO energy  left. Take your final breath full of regret. This sounds pretty depressing, doesn’t it? Yet, most people would feel  privileged  to live a life like this. If you want more out of life, there is a better way. Let me introduce you to  The Amazing Escape Plan .

My Amazon business has allowed me to literally quit a  horrendous  job that literally brought me to tears in 2018 to pursue my passion for traveling the world and living life on my own terms. This course can transform your mind and life as you know it but don’t take my word for it! Read just a few of these raving student testimonials for yourself… “The value that this course offers goes way more than what you spend on it. If you are struggling to achieve your goals on Amazon FBA, this course has the tools to keep you moving on the right track. A few years ago, I bought the most expensive course on the market (around $5000), but received less value than this amazing course for a few bucks. Sumner does an excellent job of breaking the content down for everyone to understand. Thank you Sumner :).”   - Ardie L “Do yourself a favor and buy this course if you are interested in Amazon FBA. Sadly, I must say that I purchased this course when it was on sale, but it would definitely be worth the full price as this course is amazing. I will admit that I was one of those idiots that purchased expensive courses for learning Amazon FBA. Other than a few courses on Udemy I also purchased a course at $400 and purchased a mentorship at $1,350 and then purchased another course on Amazon and Ranking that was $5,000. The funny thing is, is that I keep coming back to this course to learn. This course far surpasses the value of the other courses I had purchased and it was not even 1/4th the price.”  - Eric N “It is kind of hard to describe the quantity of information Sumner communicates in this course. It's a long course (19.5hrs). During the whole time Sumner is fresh, prepared and he clearly explains all topics. And I mean ALL topics. He covers all areas of Amazon FBA but then goes further with pointers to other aspects of e-commerce which you can explore. I have an amazing number of new bookmarks pointing to critical tools in my browser and a huge number of bookmarks within the course. The bookmarks within the course will be my guideposts to go back and review topics as they come up in my business, which I'm sure they will. If you are going to do Amazon FBA take this course. It will take you a while to go through it but you will thank the e-commerce spirits for guiding you to it. Best of luck and Here's to a prosperous year. Thank you Sumner!”   - Erbium D “First of all, if you want to learn about all things Amazon, but find those Amazon Seller courses advertised on Youtube obnoxious and over the top, this Udemy course is for you. This is a nuts and bolts, no-nonsense course, filled with loads of relevant and insightful content. The instructor provides not only the basics, but goes above and beyond in offering tips, tricks, and loads of professional advice on the marketing side of the business (I believe his university focus was on marketing--so this is a pleasant surprise). I believe Sumner found a gap in this AMZ seller education market, and has filled the niche nicely with top-notch course material, great referrals, and attentive responses to student questions. I took the course at a steep discount, however easily worth the full $200 value.”  - Cory T ""Life changing"" indeed as the instructor promised at the beginning. If one listens to every word and takes massive action, the world is yours! These words are coming from someone who has tested out too many courses in the market. Just checked my Udemy course purchases to validate. :)”  - Guatam P “I have no experience with Amazon sales. His lessons are great for me so far because they are detailed, and he explains every step of the process. I actually appreciate that he speaks fast so that we can get through each lesson quickly. I can always pause and replay if I miss something, so I don't know why some reviewers complained about that. So far, I am really learning a lot of valuable information.”  -  Cori V “Excellent course! Much more content and information than what I expected. I will definitely start my Amazon FBA business using the information I received here. Thanks Sumner for all your information and help.”  -  Ferdinand G "" Great course, gives some great pointers and tips on how to scale your Amazon business.

What will this PyTorch course be like? This PyTorch course is very hands-on and project based. You won't just be staring at your screen. We'll leave that for other PyTorch tutorials and courses. In this course you'll actually be: Running experiments Completing exercises to test your skills Building real-world deep learning models and projects to mimic real life scenarios By the end of it all, you'll have the skillset needed to identify and develop modern deep learning solutions that Big Tech companies encounter. ⚠ Fair warning:  this course is  very comprehensive . But don't be intimidated, Daniel will teach you everything from scratch and step-by-step! Here's what you'll learn in this PyTorch course: 1. PyTorch Fundamentals  — We start with the barebone fundamentals, so even if you're a beginner you'll get up to speed. In machine learning, data gets represented as a tensor (a collection of numbers). Learning how to craft tensors with PyTorch is paramount to building machine learning algorithms. In PyTorch Fundamentals we cover the PyTorch tensor datatype in-depth. 2. PyTorch Workflow  — Okay, you’ve got the fundamentals down, and you've made some tensors to represent data, but what now? With PyTorch Workflow you’ll learn the steps to go from data -> tensors -> trained neural network model. You’ll see and use these steps wherever you encounter PyTorch code as well as for the rest of the course. 3. PyTorch Neural Network Classification  — Classification is one of the most common machine learning problems. Is something one thing or another? Is an email spam or not spam? Is credit card transaction fraud or not fraud? With PyTorch Neural Network Classification you’ll learn how to code a neural network classification model using PyTorch so that you can classify things and answer these questions. 4. PyTorch Computer Vision  — Neural networks have changed the game of computer vision forever. And now PyTorch drives many of the latest advancements in computer vision algorithms. For example, Tesla use PyTorch to build the computer vision algorithms for their self-driving software. With PyTorch Computer Vision you’ll build a PyTorch neural network capable of seeing patterns in images of and classifying them into different categories. 5. PyTorch Custom Datasets  — The magic of machine learning is building algorithms to find patterns in your own custom data. There are plenty of existing datasets out there, but how do you load your own custom dataset into PyTorch? This is exactly what you'll learn with the PyTorch Custom Datasets section of this course. You’ll learn how to load an image dataset for FoodVision Mini: a PyTorch computer vision model capable of classifying images of pizza, steak and sushi (am I making you  hungry  to learn yet?!). We’ll be building upon FoodVision Mini for the rest of the course. 6. PyTorch Going Modular  — The whole point of PyTorch is to be able to write Pythonic machine learning code. There are two main tools for writing machine learning code with Python: A Jupyter/Google Colab notebook (great for experimenting) Python scripts (great for reproducibility and modularity) In the PyTorch Going Modular section of this course, you’ll learn how to take your most useful Jupyter/Google Colab Notebook code and turn it reusable Python scripts. This is often how you’ll find PyTorch code shared in the wild. 7. PyTorch Transfer Learning  — What if you could take what one model has learned and leverage it for your own problems? That’s what PyTorch Transfer Learning covers. You’ll learn about the power of transfer learning and how it enables you to take a machine learning model trained on millions of images, modify it slightly, and enhance the performance of FoodVision Mini, saving you time and resources. 8. PyTorch Experiment Tracking  — Now we're going to start cooking with  heat  by starting Part 1 of our Milestone Project of the course! At this point you’ll have built plenty of PyTorch models. But how do you keep track of which model performs the best? That’s where PyTorch Experiment Tracking comes in. Following the machine learning practitioner’s motto of  experiment, experiment, experiment!  you’ll setup a system to keep track of various FoodVision Mini experiment results and then compare them to find the best. 9. PyTorch Paper Replicating  — The field of machine learning advances quickly. New research papers get published every day. Being able to read and understand these papers takes time and practice. So that’s what PyTorch Paper Replicating covers. You’ll learn how to go through a machine learning research paper and replicate it with PyTorch code. At this point you'll also undertake Part 2 of our Milestone Project, where you’ll replicate the groundbreaking Vision Transformer architecture! 10. PyTorch Model Deployment  — By this stage your FoodVision model will be performing quite well. But up until now, you’ve been the only one with access to it. How do you get your PyTorch models in the hands of others? That’s what PyTorch Model Deployment covers. In Part 3 of your Milestone Project, you’ll learn how to take the best performing FoodVision Mini model and deploy it to the web so other people can access it and try it out with their own food images. What's the bottom line? Machine learning's growth and adoption is exploding, and deep learning is how you take your machine learning knowledge to the next level. More and more job openings are looking for this specialized knowledge. Companies like Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI, Meta (Facebook + Instagram), Airbnb and many others are currently powered by PyTorch. And this is the most comprehensive online bootcamp to learn PyTorch and kickstart your career as a Deep Learning Engineer. So why wait? Advance your career and earn a higher salary by mastering PyTorch and adding deep learning to your toolkit?",€94.99,en_US

That fit your risk preferences and goals?                 •           How can you calculate your expected return on your investment?                 •           How would you analyze the returns for your investment company?                 •           How do you structure an investment with investment partners?                 •           How do you analyze operating assets?         If you know how to do all of that, this course isn’t for you. The good news I have plenty of advanced courses available as well, feel free to check those out right now to find the one that’s appropriate for your experience level.   Having said that, I put A LOT of useful materials in here so you're more than likely going to learn something new.   I've had folks who had over  20 years  of experience find something of value in this course, so I’m certain you can too.   Why is there so much math and number crunching?     You can't properly evaluate a real estate investment without looking at its numbers.  So if you hate math and don't like numbers, this course isn't for you.  Serious real estate analysis is probably not for you either.    Why do you use Excel so much?   Good question.  Analyzing real estate investments involves looking at the numbers and it's easiest to do so with spreadsheets, which is why I use Excel extensively in this course.  But the good thing is you  DO NOT  have to build any of the models yourself.  You just need to be able to follow along and then you'll be able to use the models I give you.     Can you make me rich by taking your course?     No, not just from taking the course. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil. What I  can  guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge and techniques that can then lead you to being more profitable with your investments.   What else does this course cover besides real estate investing?     This course is ALL about and ONLY about professional real estate investing analysis concepts and techniques. Nothing else. But as you can see, this topic alone offers quite a bit to cover already.   Actually, I do cover one more thing: I will also cover daily affirmations that help you build that winning mindset. Oh, and I’ll have lots of sales videos that will push you to sign up for my super top secret real estate system for only 12 monthly low payments of just $999. Just kidding.   What will I be able to do after I take your course?   After taking my course, you will be:             •           Able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques.                 •           Able to evaluate both residential AND commercial real estate opportunities.                 •           Able to structure investments with business partners in a smart and equitable way via the waterfall framework                 •           Know how to identify and mitigate investment risks.     What WON'T I get from this course?                 •           You will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis.                 •           Due to the sheer number of students, I am unfortunately unable to help you evaluate your personal investment deals in this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here. If you really want me to consult with you privately, my hourly rate is $350/hr with a minimum of 20 hours per request.                 •           This course does not cover any of the wide range of OTHER real estate topics, which deserve their own courses, including but not limited to: contract negotiations, real estate law, real estate marketing, REITs, etc...  I try to cover the most important concepts as it relates to evaluating investment opportunities.    Diego Ginzo - 5 stars ""Excelente. Son clarisimas las explicaciones y la conceptualizacion"" Larry Butler - 5 stars “Like the Bacchanal buffet in Las Vegas for real estate investing--a lot to devour but each is deliciously made. I'm already feeling full but can't wait to go back for more platefuls. If you're hungry and have a refined palette with respect to real estate, look no further.”   What’s holding you back?   Are you afraid this course won’t work?  I assure you it will.   Are you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have.   Are you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business, if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results.   Best of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk.

I say no more to copy-pasting code that you don’t understand. Welcome to the bestselling REST API course on Udemy! I'm Jose. I'm a software engineer, here to help you truly understand and develop your skills in web and REST API development with Python, Flask, and Docker. Production-ready REST APIs with Flask This course will guide you in creating  simple, intermediate, and advanced  REST APIs including  authentication ,  deployments ,  databases , and  much more . We'll start with a Python refresher that will take you from the very basics to some of the most advanced features of Python—that's all the Python you need to complete the course. Using  Flask  and popular extensions  Flask-Smorest ,  Flask-JWT-Extended , and  Flask-SQLAlchemy  we will dive right into developing complete, solid, production-ready REST APIs. We will also look into essential technologies like  Git  and database migrations with  Alembic . You'll be able to... Create resource-based, production-ready REST APIs using Python, Flask, and popular Flask extensions; Handle secure user registration and authentication with Flask. Using SQLAlchemy and Flask-SQLAlchemy to easily and efficiently store resources to a database; and Understand the complex intricacies of deployments of Flask REST APIs. Use Docker to simplify running and deploying your REST APIs. But what is a REST API anyway? A REST API is an application that accepts data from clients and returns data back. For example, a REST API could accept text data from the client, such as a username and password, and return whether that is a valid user in the database. When developing REST APIs, our clients are usually web apps or mobile apps. That's in contrast to when we make websites, where the clients are usually the users themselves. Together we'll develop a REST API that not only allows clients to authenticate but also to store and retrieve any data you want from a database. Learning this will help you develop any REST API that you need for your own projects! I pride myself on providing  excellent support and feedback  to every single student. I am  always available to guide you and answer your questions . I'll see you on the inside. Take your first step towards REST API mastery!",€94.99,en_US

There can be no understating it: Ethereum and Blockchain technology is the most disruptive force in years.  Companies cannot hire developers who understand blockchain technologies fast enough, but there are a tiny number of resources published to help you truly  understand  what blockchains are used for, let alone build apps with them.  That's the purpose of this course:  to be the  best resource online  for learning about Ethereum, blockchains, and how to build apps with this new technology.   The development community is still figuring out the best way to use Ethereum in the creation of new and exciting apps.  I spent a tremendous amount of time to research and create best practice for interfacing with Ethereum from Javascript.  I can't overstate it enough; this course will show you the best and  most easily repeatable patterns  for creating production-ready apps with Ethereum.   What tools and libraries are used?   The Ethereum tech ecosystem is in constant change.  Don't be fooled by other courses that mention how you'll learn a dozen different libraries!  Every library that you'll use with Ethereum breaks and is deprecated on a near-weekly basis!  Instead, this course will teach you  how to assemble your own boilerplate package  to develop, compile, and test Smart Contracts.  By learning the  core technologies , you'll be prepared to adjust to Ethereum no matter how the ecosystem changes.   What is Ethereum?   Ethereum is a cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin, and it has been heralded as  Bitcoins successor .  Whereas Bitcoin currently has issues scaling with an increasing backlog of transactions, Ethereum is poised to surpass Bitcoin in performance, popularity, and value.  Ethereum was created to help developers like you create applications focused around transferring money or value from one party to another.   What is Solidity?   Solidity is a programming language for writing Smart Contracts.  Essentially, think of it as a way to control a bank account with code.  With Solidity, we can write applications that simulate a crowd funding campaign, a lottery, a loan, or any other type of financial instrument.  Don't be intimidated by learning 'another' programming language; Solidity is known to be quite similar to Javascript and exceptionally easy to pick up for anyone who has previous JS experience.  This course will give you all the tools you need to master Solidity.",€99.99,en_US
https://www.udemy.com/course/financial-modeling-asimplemodel/,Introduction to Financial Modeling,Learn to build a simple integrated financial statement model.,"This course will teach you how to use two years of historical income statement data and two years of historical balance sheet data to build a fully integrated financial statement model.  It is designed for those new to financial models.             Section 1  will introduce the accounting equation and the three primary financial statements in the context of building a financial model. The content starts with the accounting equation, which is the single most important concept in accounting. The remaining three videos introduce the financial statements one at a time with a focus on the relationships that are important as you build financial models.       	        All of the material is provided via video-driven instruction with notes in pdf format to help follow along.               Section 2  will walk through integrating the three primary financial statements and creating a five-year projection. The first video provides a quick overview of the process. It is an easier process to grasp if thought of as a series of steps. It will also make it easier to measure progress as you work through the longer video. The video in Lecture 2 will walk you through the process of building the model cell by cell.       	        Because you are walking through the entire process of building a model, the video in Lecture 2 runs long: 35 minutes total. My advice would be to download the excel template attached to this lecture and build the model as the video progresses. Building the model yourself is the best way to fully understand the process.              In my opinion, if you want to build a strong financial modeling skill set, a thorough understanding of how an integrated financial statement model works is one of the most important things you can learn.       	      The last video in this section will explain circular references and how to fix broken models. It can be incredibly frustrating to finish a model and realize that it does not ""balance."" This video will help avoid that frustration.       	            I hope the content is useful to you! Please feel free to email me (peter@ASimpleModel.com) with any feedback.

Learn to design and build modern cloud apps from a certified Azure Architect,"Learn Microsoft Azure from a certified, experienced Azure Architect. *** One of the fastest selling Azure courses on Udemy! ***  (See what students of this course are saying about it later on this page) Change Log ========= [April 2022 Update] Major update including the new Networking experience, complete overhaul of AKS and lots more. [January 2023 Update] Some minor updates to reflect the new Activity Log export experience. [February 2023 Update] Update to the Azure SQL deployment and firewall rules deployment, and to MySQL deployment. [June 2023 Update] Use the built-in ACR Docker build capabilities instead of building Docker on local computer. Use the updated Azure Function extension. Microsoft Azure is one of the most popular public clouds in the industry, and it gets bigger and bigger by the day. Thousands of organizations, from all sizes and shapes, are moving to the cloud, and  being able to work with it is one of the most important skills for every developer, architect, or IT admin. And  this course does just that . If you'll take this course,  you'll become a real expert in Microsoft Azure. We start from the very basics - what is the cloud and what it's good for - and go to the most advanced concepts such as Azure Policy, Cost management, and lots more. By the end of this course  you'll be familiar with the major services in Azure , and also some real hidden gems known only to the few (Azure IMDS, for instance), and you'll be able to work with Azure and design and build modern cloud apps, utilizing the most up-to-date cloud services. Here is a partial list of what we'll talk about in this course: - What is the cloud - Azure vs other clouds - The Azure portal - Azure Compute - Virtual Machines, App Services, AKS, Azure Functions and more - Azure Networking - VNets, Subnets, NSG, Application Gateway and more - Data in Azure - Azure SQL, CosmosDB, Azure MySQL, Storage Account and more - Messaging in Azure - Event Grid, Queues, Service Bus, Event Hubs - Azure Active Directory (also known as Azure AD) - Logging and Monitoring in Azure - Securing systems in Azure - Cost Management - Disaster Recovery (DR) And lots and lots more... Now, to make sure that  this course is the best Azure course out there , I've decided to make it a little bit different. Instead of going through the various features of Azure, talking about each one and perhaps even doing a demo - this course takes a different approach. We're going to build, together, a full blown modern cloud system on Azure . Together, we're going to build the  readit  website, a fictional bookstore that's built in Azure. We're going to begin with the very basics - take a code and put it on a virtual machine in the cloud. And then we're going to add more compute elements, add networking, databases, messaging, monitoring, security, and even DR!  (Take a look at the video preview - you can see there the architecture diagram of the system at the beginning, and how it looks like when we're done with it. Worth watching...) And when we're done -  you'll be able to say that you've built a complete system in Azure! This is something you can show future employers and clients, and explain them how the system is designed, and what are the reasons it's built like this. Now, don't worry about the code.  Everything it going to be provided to you . The system is built using .NET Core and nodeJS, but you don't have to be familiar with these languages, you just better have some development knowledge. There is no other course like this! This is the only Azure course that takes you step-by-step towards a complete, full blown system in the cloud. At the end of it -  you can definitely call yourself Azure Expert. But that's not all... At the end of this course, you'll be able to download the  Azure Architecture Summary , a comprehensive, step-by-step guide that summarizes what we've learned in the course, and that will help you design great Azure apps. This summary is an extremely handy doc to use when designing future Azure apps. I use it and it helps me a lot - and so should you... This course takes you from the absolute basics of Azure to the most advanced topics, known only to few. Completing this course will give you all the knowledge required for designing modern, robust, secure and reliable cloud systems, and, as a bonus, will put you in a great position when looking for your next job. No other course covers this topic in such a comprehensive and thorough way . I've put all my 20+ years of experience with hundreds of clients in this course, and I'm sure you will greatly benefit from it. ------------------------------------------------------------ What do my students have to say about this course? ------------------------------------------------------------ ""This is  the best Azure course  I have encountered on Udemy or anywhere.

The gaming industry is a $200 billion industry worldwide. By 2025, that number is expected to be near $300 billion. With  Unity being the most widely used engine to develop games across multiple platforms , there has never been a better time to get into the field. As you will learn, the types of games you can create with Unity and C# are limitless. Game development makes a great hobby, allowing you to learn a new skill and play your game with family and friends. It is also an exciting and rewarding career, where plenty of successful developers, including myself, have learned the fundamentals of game development through courses like this, and not in the traditional classroom setting.  Every great game starts somewhere, so why not make it yours?  While people often find coding or making games intimidating, this Unity course utilizes a unique teaching method that will allow you to gain a thorough understanding of concepts while you develop your own games. Thanks to the Unity community, you’ll be able to connect with other developers, work together on new projects, and make some incredible games! Why Learn From Me This is the first and only Unity game development course that has been co-created with Unity Technologies on Udemy.  Because learning to code can be daunting, Unity Technologies wanted to create a course that helps new developers feel comfortable exploring the engine and developing games. I believe that the best way to learn how to code is by doing. Therefore,  this is a highly interactive series that does not spoon-feed you the answers.  The unique challenges integrated throughout this Unity course will ensure you not only know how to code something, but also understand the logic behind it. As a  self-taught software engineer , I found that there simply weren’t any high-quality video tutorials that allowed beginners to truly grasp concepts essential to game development. To remedy this, I created my own YouTube video series focused on Unity game development, where I’ve had the privilege of helping thousands of other people grow their passion for game development.   I’ve been working in Unity since the initial public release of version 2.6, and I’ve authored a book on Unity 3.X. Since beginning my career in software development, I’ve been fortunate enough to develop games for Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and several indie game companies. I’ve also developed enterprise augmented reality applications for Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola, GE, and Thyssenkrupp. Teaching has always been a passion of mine, and I hope you will see that throughout this course.   Upon completing this Unity course, you will understand the concepts of C# programming and be able to continue developing your own 2D and 3D games. You will also feel confident knowing that you have mastered the latest and greatest game development techniques that will propel you to success in your professional or personal aspirations.

Very specific, real-world examples . It covered several instances of 'what is happening', 'what it means' and 'how you fix it'.  I was impressed. ""  Steve       Welcome to  The Top 5 Machine Learning Libraries in Python.   This is an introductory course on the process of building  supervised machine learning models  and then using libraries in a computer programming language called  Python .        What’s the  top career in the world ? Doctor? Lawyer? Teacher? Nope.  None of those.     The top career in the world is the  data scientist.  Great. What’s a data scientist?        The area of study which involves  extracting knowledge from data  is called Data Science and people  practicing  in this field are called as  Data Scientists.     Business generate a  huge amount of data.   The data has tremendous value but there so much of it where do you begin to look for value that is actionable? That’s where the data scientist comes in.  The job of the data scientist is to  create predictive models  that can find hidden patterns in data that will give the business a competitive advantage in their space.        Don’t I need a PhD?   Nope . Some data scientists do have PhDs but it’s  not a requirement.   A similar career to that of the data scientist is the  machine learning engineer.     A  machine learning engineer  is a person who  builds predictive models,  scores them and then puts them into production so that others in the company can consume or use their model.  They are usually  skilled programmers  that have a solid background in data mining or other data related professions and they have learned predictive modeling.        In the course  we are going to take a look at what machine learning engineers do. We are going to learn about the  process of building supervised predictive models  and build several using the most widely used programming language for machine learning.  Python.  There are literally hundreds of  libraries  we can import into Python that are machine learning related.        A  library  is simply a group of code that  lives outside the core language . We “ import it”  into our work space when we need to use its functionality. We can mix and match these libraries like Lego blocks.

Is your computer too space-limited to install >2GB programs? Then this course might be right for you. You will learn how to use Octave-online as a tool for learning the MATLAB programming language. Octave is a free cross-platform numerical processing software that interprets almost all MATLAB code (and code from many other programming languages). Therefore, people often use it as a way to learn and use MATLAB even if they don’t have access to MATLAB. But most people install Octave locally on their computer. That’s fine, of course. But there are times when you want to use a program without having to install it. That’s the neat part of Octave-online: You don't need to download or install anything! All you need is a browser and an internet connection. And I assume you have that if you’re reading this text ;) Please note that this is not a course on programming; this is a course on using an online tool that will help you learn MATLAB programming. That means you won’t learn how to program in MATLAB here; you will learn about a free tool that you can use to help you learn MATLAB.",Free,en_US

This course will teach you all the necessary basics and advanced tools, but it's not PowerPoint 101 for beginners. I mention basic tools and techniques, but I assume that you are computer savvy and know how to find your way around PowerPoint already.  BUT!  If you aren't then I have prepared a completely FREE PowerPoint basics course, which will equip you with the knowledge necessary to take this one. It's available on my profile under free courses. It's called ""PowerPoint for Beginners - Program & Animation Basics FREE"" Q:  I'm enrolled in your PowerPoint Masterclass - Presentation Design & Animation course.  Should I get this one or is the other one enough? Which one is better? Good Question! Both courses are top PowerPoint courses that teach you the knowledge and tools to create outstanding presentations, animations, and templates. They are just two different versions that use different slides and unique content respectively. The benefit of that is you can follow a different design path on each course. Students who finished the first master's course were asking me for more, and I'm happy to provide more if there is demand for it. If you already feel super comfortable with PowerPoint, one course is enough. But if you seek even more design ideas and slides, and if you like my content and the way I teach, you won't go wrong by taking both courses. Each of those two courses has several unique sections that allow them to expand their knowledge in their own way. Q:  I've been using PowerPoint for 15+ years and think I know it already. Will I learn anything new?   I'm an experienced PowerPoint instructor with over 250 YouTube tutorials and more than 10 published PowerPoint courses and series. Over the past few years, I have learned from both beginner and advanced students which areas to address to best influence your workflow in a positive and impactful way. My courses help you to boost your efficiency, using shortcuts and on-trend designs to help you to reach a modern, top-level standard of quality. If you need something that is not already in the course, you can always ask me about topics to add to courses that interest you.   Q:  I'm still not sure if I want to invest in this course. I don't know if I want to focus on design or on animation. Is there any fall-back plan?  Of course! First, you should watch the promo videos and watch the free preview lessons. They will give you a good understanding of the course content, pace, and what to expect from taking the course.

They all use DevOps  to continuously build and release software. (Don't take my word for it; stop reading now and go put ""devops"" into a LinkedIn job search.)  In this Azure DevOps Fundamentals course,  Microsoft Certified Trainer and bestselling Udemy instructor Brian Culp  guides students on a hands-on tour of Azure DevOps -- Microsoft's cloud-based, open-source tool to help organizations manage development teams,  code, and application deployments. Best of all, Brian understands that students taking a Fundamentals course may not yet be familiar with all the vocabulary. This course makes  no assumptions  about prior exposure to the overwhelming set of terms and technologies that are part of the DevOps landscape... terms like Agile, Scrum, VS Code, App Containers, Commits, Code Requests, Sprints, Unit Testing, Code Artifacts, and literally dozens of others that live at the place where your Development and Operations teams meet. In Azure DevOps Fundamentals for Beginners, we take one small step at a time in our journey. It's not a data dump. Instead, the course provides each building block the proper context at the time it's needed. In addition, you'll build your understanding with hands-on guidance using the essential Azure DevOps tools:  Boards, Repos, Pipelines, and Test Plans.   Everything that needs a definition is defined along the way. Brian has been teaching people about Microsoft solutions for  over 15 years,  and some of his courses have been selected  by Microsoft  as their official training for Office 365 Administrators. Now, he brings that same expertise to some of the highest-rated courses on Udemy. There's a reason for the hundreds of five-star reviews. ""Excellent content!  Just what I was looking for to enhance productivity at the office.""  -Paige Popejoy ""Great personality and explained things well. Felt like he was at my desk explaining it to me.""   -William Potts  ""I can't believe how much I learned. The instructor is great and the lessons were so easy to follow.""  Sherie L. ""Very precise, clear and constructive.""  -Forent Sidler ""Perfect.""   -Yvonne Belo Azure DevOps Fundamentals for Beginners   is perfect for IT professionals who have heard the term DevOps, but want some hands-on experience, or for project managers and product owners who want to better understand a CI/CD workflow used by development teams. It's even great for the stone-cold noobs out there (we all are at one point, after all) who just want to be able to see if DevOps might be a good career fit.   You'll learn by watching and listening, but you'll also learn by  doing.  By the second lesson, you'll have configured your first DevOps organization. By the time you've finished, you'll have deployed an app into an Azure container, and will have gained additional confidence and expertise about topics like these: Managing dev teams using Azure Boards Mapping work items to your organization's Agile or Scrum processes  Setting up Git-based workflows in Azure Repos Connecting to existing code repos in GitHub Building code every time a commit is saved to a Master branch Deploying a new code artifact when new builds are ready Performing tests of code using Azure Test Plans Plus confidence to integrate other tools (Docker, Maven, etc) into your team's DevOps implementation Best of all, you become more  valuable  as companies all over the world scramble - and compete - for workers who understand DevOps.  (You did do that LinkedIn search, correct?) And as always,  you get ongoing support.  (Brian and the team answers all student questions, usually within one business day). Plus, you're always covered by Udemy's refund policy. Enroll now,  and discover where your own DevOps journey can lead. See you in class!",€119.99,en_US

This course has been  expertly crafted  to make sure that you  rapidly improve  your Linux skills,  Turbocharge your productivity  and  Boost your career  with  no time wasting  and  no useless fluff . Course Structure Topic 1) Mastering the Linux Terminal Understand the How AND Why of the Linux Command Line If you want  true mastery , it's not enough to learn how to do something. You need to  understand why. In this section, you will  learn what Linux commands are, and how they are structured  so that you can get  valuable insight  into how working with the Linux command line works, rather than just memorising command after command after command like other Linux courses will make you do.     You will  learn important concepts  such as: The difference between the Linux terminal and the shell Command Input and Output Data Redirection. Connecting Linux Commands together to Build Sophisticated Data Pipelines. And so many other useful concepts that will give you the fundamental skills to confidently use the command line to accomplish anything you want. This course also  focuses on empowering you  to be an  independent learner  of the Linux operating system so you will also learn how to use the Linux Manual. Knowing how to use the Linux manual will give you the independence to do what you want to do, rather than just what other people have shown you. Topic 2) Mastering the Linux File System           Increase Productivity by Working with Files from the Linux Command Line Once you’ve become a master of the Linux terminal and understood the  critical concepts  behind what you’re doing, you will then move on to gain mastery over the  Linux File System .     Working with Files is what we do 99% of the time when we work with computers and in this section you will learn how to navigate the file system from the command line and perform a whole bunch of tasks with files and folders such as: How to  Create files and folders  in Linux  How to  Delete files and folders  in Linux How to  Copy and paste files and folders  in Linux. How to  Move and Rename files and folders  in Linux. How to  Find files  and  Sort data  in Linux. How to  Backup and Compress files and folders  in Linux. But you'll  do it all from the Linux command line! You will also learn some  productivity tips  to squeeze every bit of juice out of your command line work as well as getting a tour of the Linux file system so that you  feel right at home  :) Topic 3) Mastering Task Automation and Scheduling         Save time by automating the boring stuff! Once you’ve mastered the Linux file system, we will turn our attention to  task automation and scheduling.      Now, if you’re the kind of person who loves to automate tasks and  free up your spare time , you will LOVE this section!  We will cover how to  write bash scripts  and automate them using a special scheduling program called  cron  so that you can  automate the boring stuff  and  increase your productivity . Topic 4) Mastering Package Managers and Software Repositories           Discover new tools and possibilities by exploring Open Source Software.  Then in the Final section of the course, we will turn our attention to  Linux software management .

https://www.udemy.com/course/manual-lymphatic-drainage-massage/,Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage Certificate Course (6CEU),Manual lymphatic drainage massage will change your massage practice. Learn how to do this powerful massage technique,"Learn how to do manual lymphatic drainage massage (MLD) from best-selling massage course instructor, Mark Perren-Jones. Studies have shown that by doing manual lymphatic drainage massage techniques you can speed up the movement of lymph in the body by up to 20 times faster! Adding manual lymphatic drainage massage to your massage therapy skill set opens up numerous possibilities for client referrals. Manual lymph drainage massage is a gentle but powerful manual technique that stimulates a malfunctioning or fatigued lymphatic system.  Keeping the lymphatic system in good condition is imperative for promoting good health, and for restoring good health when the system has been compromised. Adding manual lymph drainage massage to your massage therapy skill set opens up numerous possibilities to help your massage clients and for to get more massage client referrals.  Manual lymph drainage massage is a gentle manual technique that stimulates a malfunctioning or fatigued lymphatic system. Keeping the lymphatic system in good condition is imperative for promoting good health, and for restoring good health when the system has been compromised. A big part of the lymphatic system is located very close to the surface of the body, thus manual lymph drainage techniques are applied very effectively with much less pressure than regular massage. This reduces wear and tear on the massage therapist’s body. After completing this course, you will be able to: Do self manual lymphatic drainage massage to your body to help with your own health Know how to do a full body manual lymphatic drainage massage on another person Do a rejuvenating facial treatment for yourself or your massage clients Use essential oils to enhance lymphatic drainage massage Do scar release techniques to make any scars less restrictive and more pliable Treat people with auto-immune diseases using manual lymphatic drainage massage such as fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis Give people a full body manual lymphatic drainage massage to give them an incredible sense of deep relaxation Help people with sluggish lymphatic systems that make people feel low in energy Treat people post-operatively from orthopedic and cosmetic surgeries to speed up their healing time Treat acute injuries to help people heal more quickly Effectively treat chronic inflammatory conditions Give dietary recommendations to help with fluid retention problems Understand and treat mild lymphedema both for yourself and your massage clients And so much more! What are people saying? ""I just wanted to say I am so impressed with the content of this course as a qualified lymphatic drainage therapist, I am always looking for JUST that something that can fill the gaps and really just explain the practical side better. Well, all I can say is WOW!!! Your course is even better than the well known Lymphatic drainage courses that are seen to be the best, teaches you a lot of theory but the practical side is often rushed and makes one feel you haven't quite grasp it all. I am overjoyed with your course and cannot wait to take my practice to the next level!"" Who needs MLD? Lymph massage can benefit just about everyone! Many massage therapy clients suffer from either acute or chronic conditions that affect the lymphatic drainage system where normal massage techniques are not suitable or ineffective. These conditions are therefore more appropriately addressed with manual lymph drainage than regular massage.  Clients who respond very favorably to manual lymph drainage include those with post-traumatic and postsurgical swelling, also known as edema. Swelling from a soft-tissue injury causes significant discomfort and pain and slows the healing process. Manual lymph drainage addresses this painful swelling and significantly reduces overall healing time.  Post-surgical clients who can benefit from manual lymph drainage massage include those recovering from cosmetic surgeries such as face-lifts, breast augmentation, and liposuction and orthopedic surgeries such as joint repair or replacement. Manual lymph drainage massage is incredibly effective in reducing swelling even before appropriate muscle movement and function can be restored. Reduction in swelling is not the only benefit this technique provides. According to a 1989 study, “Experimental and clinical studies of the mechanism of effect of manual lymph drainage massage therapy,” in the German publication  Zeitschrift fur Lymphologie  ( Journal of Lymphology ), manual lymph drainage improves lymph flow; since waste elimination is an essential function of the lymphatic system, it follows that improved lymph flow helps eliminate waste products and inflammatory mediators from injured tissue. This leads to less pain, reduced scar tissue formation and faster healing overall. Manual lymph drainage massage is also very effective in a variety of autoimmune disorders where regular massage can be contraindicated, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. The most significant benefits of manual lymph drainage massage for these clients are a decrease in hypersensitivity and pain, as indicated in the study “Comparison of MLD Therapy and Connective Tissue Massage in Women with Fibromyalgia: A Randomized Controlled Trial,” National University of Health Sciences, Turkey, 2009; a decrease in tissue congestion and inflammatory mediators; and increased range of motion. In addition, in many of these clients, manual lymph drainage promotes a more restful sleep pattern and less overall fatigue. Manual lymph drainage massage also assists with stimulating the parasympathetic response in the body, so it’s indicated in situations where the nervous system has been compromised, such as with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. These clients will benefit from general stress reduction, detoxification and enhanced immune function. Over the last decade, manual lymph drainage has come to be recognized for its profound benefits to oncology clients immediately after surgery and later during their ongoing recovery period. MLD reduces edema, helps control pain, relieves constipation caused by pain medications, provides general relaxation, reduces stress and improves sleep. Due to the complexity of treatment and care for oncology patients, massage therapists may need to coordinate with their client’s physician. Oncology clients who have undergone lymph node removal as part of their cancer treatment often develop a very specific swelling called lymphedema caused by localized damage to the lymphatic circulatory system. While a manual lymph drainage practitioner is able to address simple, medically uncomplicated lymphedema, more complex clients—especially those with additional medical issues—should be referred to a physician or certified lymphedema specialist.

As a currency, I have chosen the GBPUSD because this is one of the most stable currency pairs with a low spread, making it suitable for Forex algorithmic trading. It is fundamentally important when trading with Expert Advisors to use currencies with a small spread. This way we increase our profits. I will provide the 10 Expert Advisors ready for trading, and in addition, I will make sure they are always suitable for the current market conditions. This way, you will have Expert Advisors that are always applicable to the current market conditions. All you need to do is follow their performance and choose the best Forex robot for yourself. I have used EA Studio, a professional strategy builder. You will see the complete process I followed, and If you want to use the strategy builder for yourself, you can sign up for a free trial version and practice generating your own strategies. However, if you prefer to use my robots, you can, because I have included them in this course. At the end of the course,   I will show you the performance of the Expert Advisors:  +700 pips in 5 days. It is essential to have precise statistics when you are trading with Expert Advisors. This way, every trader can find the top performers for a predefined period. When we do Forex algorithmic trading, we follow a simple concept: trade many Expert Advisors in one trading account follow their performance, and we place the Top Robots in a separate account always trade the Expert Advisors that are profiting on the current market conditions If any of the Expert Advisors becomes unprofitable, we replace it with another one that we already have tested Familiar mistake traders make buying expensive Expert Advisors and then realizing ""It has stopped working."" It hasn't; the market simply changed. That is why you need to have many Expert Advisors on a Demo trading account and those currently profiting in a separate live performance. This way, we use the best Expert Advisors for current market conditions, diversify our risk on many Expert Advisors, and do not rely on just one. This is the only profitable Forex algorithmic trading method. Who is your instructor? I am Petko Aleksandrov, founder of Trading Academy. I have specialized in Forex Algorithmic trading, as this is the easiest way to trade on the Forex market – there is no stress and no emotions. I focus on creating many Expert Advisors, testing them, and selecting which ones to use. This is precisely what I will share with you in this course. Algorithmic trading is the better choice for me for one more reason: we do not need to spend all of our time in front of our trading screen, drawing lines, and analyzing, watching fundamental news and predictions, etc. We place our Expert Advisors on our charts, and they trade for us. Let me know if you have any questions. I always answer my students.   It is fundamentally important to have excellent communication, so this way, I ensure that everything is clear to everyone. If you decide that this Forex Algorithmic trading system does not suit your trading style, you can always use the  30-day money-back guarantee.

In the part 2 of this course,In this part, we're going to learn how to create beautiful designs from scratch using Canva, without relying on templates. The first step in creating a beautiful design is to choose the right color palette. A well-chosen color scheme can make your design look polished and professional. To choose the right colors, consider the mood and message you want to convey. Warm colors like red, yellow, and orange can create a sense of energy and excitement, while cool colors like blue and green can create a calming effect. Next, you'll want to choose the right fonts. The font you choose should be easy to read and match the tone of your design. Serif fonts, like Times New Roman, can convey a sense of tradition and formality, while sans-serif fonts, like Arial, are more modern and informal. When it comes to arranging elements on your design, remember the rule of thirds. Divide your design into thirds both horizontally and vertically, and place your elements at the intersection points. This creates a sense of balance and visual interest. Don't be afraid to experiment with different shapes and textures to add depth to your design. You can use shapes to create a sense of flow and movement, and textures to create a tactile feel. Finally, pay attention to the details. Make sure your design is free of spelling and grammar errors, and that everything is aligned and consistent. These small details can make a big difference in how professional and polished your design looks. Remember, creating a beautiful design from scratch takes practice and patience. Keep experimenting and trying new things, and soon you'll be creating stunning designs with ease.",Free,en_US

Welcome to this course. Fully captioned in English.  This course has been continually improved and covers the AZ-204 Azure developer topics. Microsoft Azure is a skill in high demand in today's large business marketplace. If you're a developer, you know as well as I do that change is always happening. It's not possible for all of us to be up-to-date on every piece of new technology out there, but this is not one of those times. Cloud-hosting has changed the way all applications are developed—from websites, to web applications, to mobile apps, and traditional backend applications as well. The rapid adoption of the cloud has touched everything.  The next time your resume is on someone's desk—be it a promotion at work or a new job opportunity—you cannot afford to have such an obvious gap in knowledge. Can you imagine being a front-end web developer today and not being able to talk about mobile-first or responsive design? Industry trends show that developing applications using cloud-hosted components is becoming the in-demand skill of tomorrow. Having Azure skills on your resume will only help you get in front of more hiring managers and land more jobs. This course goes through all of the requirements of the Microsoft exam  AZ-204: Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure  exam. While other online resources cover bits and pieces of the topic, I can confidently say this course goes deep on everything you need to know for this exam. Multiple videos are devoted to each sub-objective, and this course also includes a full sample test so you can see how ready you are to take the real test. If you don't have much previous exposure to Azure, this course will cover each core section in detail. If you ARE already an expert at many Azure topics, you can easily skip the sections that you already know and focus on the sections that are new to you.  This Azure exam is tough. But these videos will guide you through the Azure interface, and through your own practice and experience with the platform. You get lifetime access to the course, and so there are no silly ""30-day"" countdowns that require you to pay more to extend access. This course will be here when you need it. Enroll today!

Plus, I give many insightful and effective ""white hat"" Google search strategies in order to make you a great SEO marketer.   COURSE STRUCTURE PART 1: SEO KEYWORD RESEARCH We start with Google search fundamentals. We cover SEO keyword research, blogging, and related issues. We go over keyword research tools like the Google Keyword Tool and a few other ways to get SEO keywords. Keyword research is the foundational part of SEO. It is extremely important to get it right, and we devote plenty of attention to it. COURSE STRUCTURE PART 2: ON-PAGE SEO The second part of this SEO training course covers further Google search topics like how to dominate the top-10 search results of Google with more than one listing, how to do SEO on other platforms to reach great scale, long-tail vs. short-tail keywords, Google penalties, and much more. We also cover Yoast SEO plugin for WordPress SEO. But you can do your on-page SEO using any site like Wix, WordPress SEO, SquareSpace, or Shopify SEO. Recently added: Blogger SEO in WordPress and Google marketing for Shopify SEO. COURSE STRUCTURE PART 3: OFF-PAGE SEO AND LINK BUILDING TO RANK HIGHER The third part of this SEO course focuses on off-page SEO strategies like link building so your site can rank higher. I explain what kinds of links are good to get, and what kinds of links to stay away from. I also explain how to get links by getting press coverage for your business because that is the best of both worlds. Typically links from publicity also bring you website traffic, and those links come from very strong websites in terms of Google search.   COURSE STRUCTURE PART 4: ADVANCED SEO TOPICS LIKE VOICE SEO, MOBILE SEO, SITE SPEED, AND MORE  After we cover Google search basics, we get into modern and advanced topics like voice SEO (when people talk into their mobile devices asking for things), making sure your website is mobile SEO friendly, technical SEO with site speed optimization, and more.

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-new-manager-managing-people-teams-processes/,Management Skills Training for New & Experienced Managers,"Management Skills Certification in Developing People, Leading Teams & Improving Processes in the Hybrid Work Culture","Note: at the suggestion of students, I have changed the title of this course to reflect its value for all managers, new or experienced. These are the essential management skills whether new team leader or a senior manager.  The Challenge:  Most new managers have the technical skills to succeed. What they often lack is the skill of managing, motivating and developing their employees. This course will provide those skills that are essential to your success as a manager. This course is organized around three critical blocks of skills: First, managing and motivating individuals; second, leading high performing teams; and third, engaging their people in the continuous improvement of work processes. If a you can master these skills your success is virtually guaranteed. These skills are important for EVERY level of management. It is a good refresher for middle and senior managers as well as new managers.  The lessons in this course are strongly influenced by the instructor's extensive background in lean management and in developing high performing teams. The course is ideally suited for new managers in companies wanting to develop lean culture. It is also perfect for young entrepreneurs who are just beginning their journey as managers. The instructor has 45 years of experience training managers and building a culture of teamwork at companies like Honda, Shell Oil, Corning, Honeywell and many others.  Action-Learning: This course is structured to facilitate the relationship between the new manager and a coach. There are thirteen exercises that ask the student to put the lessons to work with their team or practice with their coach. The instructor employs an ""action-learning"" model, recognizing that the best learning occurs from applying the lessons to the student's real work situation, and from receiving feedback from a coach. It is intended as a comprehensive model and curriculum for new managers.  Recognition and Celebration: When you complete this course, you will receive a certificate of completion from Udemy. However, this is a demanding course and you are asked to demonstrate competence in managing people, teams and processes. The instructor believes that you deserve more recognition. If you complete the assignments and send a portfolio of completed assignments to the instructor you will be recognized with a  Green Belt certification  by the Institute for Leadership Excellence; and, the author will send you ebook copies of his three most recent books on coaching, team leadership, and developing lean organization and culture. You deserve it! In this course the instructor speaks to the needs and experience of newly promoted managers and entrepreneurs.  I recently received the following message from one of my students who just completed this course:  ""Good morning Larry. I just finished your course and I did leave a review but just wanted to message you, to tell you, thank you for the course. I mentioned on the review but the company I work for went from a complete zoo to a respectable place to work in just under 2 months and it was mainly because of this course and your info.

In this course, Maximilian, experienced web developer as well as author of many 5-star rated Udemy courses and host of the ""Academind"" coding channel on YouTube, will take you on a hands-on journey to get you to build your own Angular + NodeJS Applications in no time.

While beginning with a very basic app and basic features, you will quickly be able to incorporate many different Routes, Observables, Events, Authentication and Authorization, Error Handling and much more into your applications. The best thing is: You’ll learn all that by putting it into practice immediately! No wall of powerpoint slides, no unrealistic mini-examples – this is the real deal! Who should take this course? Basic NodeJS/Express and Angular Experience is strongly recommended You should be familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics, too MongoDB (+ Mongoose) knowledge is a plus as MongoDB will be used in this course but won’t be subject of in-depth explanations NO expert or advanced knowledge on any of these topics is required or assumed By the end of this course, you will be able to create your own, awesome NodeJS + Angular applications!",€119.99,en_US

Effectively, Kubernetes is a management tool direct the running of Docker images. This course is designed to give you more of 'real world' application of Kubernetes.  You are given four different Spring Boot Microservices, which compose an application. The services communicate via RESTful APIs or JMS messages. You will learn how to compose each service into a Kubernetes Deployment. And then use Kubernetes Services to expose the microservices to each other. With Kubernetes, it is a best practice to configure Readiness and Liveness probes. Since our services are persisting data, we will also configure a graceful shutdown to prevent any data loss.  One common issue with Microservices is logging. Each running instance will generate its own log output. Thus, it is common to use consolidated logging.  A very common approach is to use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Elasticsearch is a full-text search engine. Logstash is used to get log data into a common format for Elasticsearch. And Kibana is a power data visualization engine. Together, these tools allow you to consolidate and search through your log data.

For your reference,  I passed a real exam over 900 points . 5 stars:   Passed with 914 on the exam . This is exam was very good in comparison to the real exam ======= Quality speaks for itself... SAMPLE QUESTION: You have migrated an on-premise SQL Server database to an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database attached to a VPC inside a private subnet. Also, the related Java application, hosted on-premise, has been moved to an Amazon Lambda function. Which of the following should you implement to connect AWS Lambda function to its RDS instance? Use Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately Configure lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet Use Environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string Configure Lambda to connect to VPC with private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS What's your guess? Scroll below for the answer... Correct: 4. CORRECT OPTION Configure Lambda to connect to VPC with private subnet and Security Group needed to access RDS  - You can configure a Lambda function to connect to private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your account. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your lambda function to the VPC to access private resources during execution. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates an elastic network interface for each combination of the security group and subnet in your function's VPC configuration. This is the right way of giving RDS access to Lambda. INCORRECT OPTIONS Use Lambda layers to connect to the internet and RDS separately  - You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. Layers will not help in configuring access to RDS instance and hence is an incorrect choice. Configure lambda to connect to the public subnet that will give internet access and use the Security Group to access RDS inside the private subnet  - This is an incorrect statement. Connecting a Lambda function to a public subnet does not give it internet access or a public IP address. To grant internet access to your function, its associated VPC must have a NAT gateway (or NAT instance) in a public subnet. Use Environment variables to pass in the RDS connection string  - You can use environment variables to store secrets securely and adjust your function's behavior without updating code. You can use environment variables to exchange data with RDS, but you will still need access to RDS, which is not possible with just environment variables. ======= Instructor My name is Stéphane Maarek, I am passionate about Cloud Computing, and I will be your instructor in this course.

https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-clean-code/,Clean Code,"Learn how to write readable, understandable and therefore maintainable code - step by step, in an example-driven way","As a developer, you should be able to write code which works - of course! Unfortunately, a lot of developers  write bad code nonetheless  - even though the code works. Because  ""working code"" is not the same as ""clean code"" ! This course teaches you how to write clean code - code which is easy to read and understand by humans, not just computers! In this course, you'll learn what exactly clean code is and, more importantly, how you can write clean code. Because if your code is written in a clean way, it's easier to read and understand and therefore easier to maintain.  Because it's NOT just the computer who needs to understand your code - your colleagues and your future self needs to be able to understand it as well! In this course, we'll dive into all the main "" pain points "" related to clean code (or bad code - depending on how you look at it) and you will not just learn what makes up bad code but of course also how to turn it into clean code. Specifically, you will learn about: Naming ""things"" (variables, properties, classes, functions, ...) properly and in a clean way Common pitfalls and mistakes you should avoid when naming things Comments and that most of them are bad Good comments you might consider adding to your code Code formatting - both horizontal and vertical formatting Functions and how to limit the number of function parameters How to write clean functions by focusing on ""one thing"" How levels of abstraction help you split functions and keep them small How to write DRY functions and avoid unexpected side effects Avoiding deeply nested control structures with guards and by extracting functionality into functions Errors and error handling as a replacement for if-statements Objects & data containers/ data structures and why that differentiation could matter Cohesion and how to write good (small!) classes The Law of Demeter and why it matters for clean code What the SOLID principles are and why they matter when it comes to writing clean code Much more! This course is a  compilation  of common patterns, best practices, principles and rules related to writing clean code. In this course, you'll learn about a  broad variety of concepts, rules, ideas, thoughts and principles  and by the end of course, you'll have a good idea of what to keep in mind when it comes to writing clean code. This is  not a design patterns or general patterns course  though - we will entirely  focus  on patterns, rules and concepts that help with  writing clean code  specifically. All these concepts and rules are backed up by  examples, code snippets and demos . And to ensure that you get the most out of this course, and you don't just learn a bunch of theory which you forget soon after, there also are  plenty of challenges  for you to apply what you learned! This course uses  Python, JavaScript and TypeScript  for code examples but you  don't need to know these languages  to follow along and get a lot out of the course. In addition, the course does  not focus on a specific programming style or paradigm  (like functional programming, object-oriented programming etc) but instead covers  general concepts and techniques  which  will always apply . What are the course prerequisites? Basic programming knowledge (no matter which language) is required! You don't need to know any specific programming language or programming paradigm to follow along NO prior experience with writing clean code is required",€109.99,en_US

Using the latest best practices in SQL, Database Management and Database Design, this course is focused on efficiency. Never spend time on confusing, out of date, incomplete tutorials anymore.  Graduates of Andrei’s courses are now working at Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, IBM, JP Morgan, Meta, + other top tech companies. We guarantee you this is the most comprehensive online resource on Databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. This project and exercise based course will introduce you to all of the modern toolchain of an SQL developer or anyone using a database in the workplace  (Product Manager, Business Analyst/Intelligence, Data Analyst, Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineer, Web Developer, Mobile Developer + any role requiring insights from data).  Along the way, we will learn practical and real world skills that will get you hired.  The curriculum is going to be very hands on as we walk you from start to finish of working with databases and SQL, all the way into learning how to scale databases, how to manage them, and even bonus material on working with Big Data, Caching using Redis, and connecting PostgreSQL to a Node.js server. We even talk about pros and cons of choosing an SQL Database vs NoSQL like MongoDB. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you SQL and Database Fundamentals and then going into advanced topics so you can make good decisions and work with any data that your company has no matter how complex! The topics covered are: - NoSQL (MongoDB) vs PostgreSQL, MySQL vs NewSQL - SQL Theory And Concepts - The Relational Model - SQL Basics - SQL Functions - Data Modification Language / DML - Data Query Language / DQL - Subqueries - Indexes - SQL Filtering / WHERE Statement - 3 Valued Logic - SQL JOINS - Window Functions - Date Filtering and Timestamps - SQL Aggregate Functions - SQL Operator Precedense - SQL ORDER BY - SQL GROUP BY - SQL Top Down Design - SQL Bottom Up Design - SQL Entity Relationship Diagram - SQL Normalization - Database Types - The role of a DBMS - Multi Table SELECT - The Software Development Lifecycle / SDLC - POSTGRES Role Management - POSTGRES Permission Management - POSTGRES Backup Strategies - POSTGRES Transaction Management/ SQL Transactions - POSTGRES/SQL Data Types - SQL Views - Redis Database - Elasticsearch - Connecting A Database To A Server/Web App (Node.js) - Data Engineering (Kafka, Hadoop, etc...) - Sharding - Replication - Backups - Vertical + Horizontal Scaling - Distributed vs Centralized Databases - Big Data + Analytics - Database Security (SQL Injections, Access Control, etc...) + more With SQL you will be able to work with all databases like:  PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, SQLite, MariaDB, Amazon Redshift, Presto, Apache Hive with Hadoop, and many many more because SQL is everywhere! You see, data is everywhere and it is the most valuable asset in the world. All the top companies need people that can work with data. That is where this course comes in. Unlike most tutorials out there, this course encompasses many fields working with many databases. Whether you want to get into the tech industry, you’re a mobile or web developer, a data scientist, a machine learning engineer, a business analyst, even sales and marketing or you have your own company. Any role that requires you to work with data will need to know this valuable skill that is SQL  (how to interact with databases, analyze, and use data) .  Here is the thing though. There are many courses on this topic.  Let me tell you 3 reasons why this course is different from any other SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL/Database tutorial online: 1. In this course you will learn to work with not just 1 but many Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Server, Redis, and so much more.  No prior programming or technical experience is necessary. We take you from absolute zero, all the way to mastery. We will go above and beyond to not just teach you SQL commands but to teach you advanced techniques, best practices, database design and how to think about performance, security, and scalability. 2. This course is taught by actual professionals who have experience and have worked with databases for some of the largest companies in the world.  Mo is a super star when it comes SQL. He has built software for the European Union, launched products for 5 Fortune 500 companies, and has consulted at Google. Andrei has worked on enterprise level apps for large tech firms in Silicon Valley as well as Toronto and has also taught others tech skills that got them into big companies like Google. By having both Andrei and Mo teach, you get to see different perspective and learn from 2 engineers as if you are working at a company together. 3. We are going to have fun here.  The course starts off with you getting hired at Keiko Corp to investigate their recent Database breach. Because we believe in learning by doing, you will be doing tons of real life assignments and exercises along the way, and eventually get to the point where you can help Keiko Corp solve their mystery by looking at their databases and analyzing hidden information. Our goals is that everyone has fun and is successful after completing the course :) This course is not about making you just watch along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No!  This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner in SQL and Databases to someone that is in the top 10% of SQL and Database experts!

Every other course online teaches you the  basic syntax   and features  of Typescript, but  only this course  will show you how to  apply Typescript on real projects , instructing you how to build large, successful projects through example. Typescript is a 'super-set' of Javascript.   That means that if you already know Javascript, you are ready to take this course.   Typescript adds in several important features to Javascript, including a type system.  This type system is designed to help you catch errors during development, rather than when you are running your code.  That means you'll be twice as productive by catching bugs earlier in development.  But besides the type system, Typescript also provides several tools for structuring large codebases and writing truly reusable code. Mastering Typescript by reading the documentation alone is challenging.   Although you might know what a 'typed array' or an 'interface' is, the documentation (and other courses!) don't show you  where  to use this features, or how to use them effectively.  The goal of this course is to help you understand why each feature of Typescript exists, and exactly where to use them. Top companies are hungry for Typescript developers.   Some of the largest web apps today are being built with Typescript.  Employers are scrambling to find engineers who are fluent with this cutting edge system.  Solid knowledge of Typescript will make you far more employable, by giving you a unique skill that few other engineers possess.  Planning on building your own apps?   Using Typescript will help you structure your project correctly from day one, ensuring that you won't be crushed under technical debt at some critical stage of your company.  In this course, you'll learn how to write reusable code, with a tremendous emphasis on leveraging classes and interfaces to make swappable 'widgets'.  You will be able to reconfigure your apps on the fly to build wildly different features with only a minimum amount of effort Learn from someone who has worked on one of the largest Typescript projects around . On professional projects of my own, I have developed plugins for an open-source, browser-based code editor called Theia.  The Theia project is absolutely gargantuan in scale, encompassing hundreds of thousands of lines of code, all written in Typescript.  This project works  only  thanks to the power of Typescript.

What's covered in each of the five PLC courses I teach here and on my own PLC Dojo site? This course, (PLC Fundamentals) teaches you how to program with the focus on ladder logic, which is the most popular PLC programming language.  The goal is to teach you everything you need to know to make a PLC do what you want it to do.  You are also given all the software necessary to both CREATE and RUN your own programs live - right on your own computer. For some people, that's all they really need. But for the people who want to really master PLC programming, they have the option of continuing into the advanced material with me. Applied Logic (Level 2) forces you to take what you've learned and solve problem after progressively harder problem unassisted.  You get a spec and are told simply: ""Make it work, and don't progress until you have.""  After, you get to watch me solve each one as well.  By the end, you don't just know how to program - you are a PROGRAMMER. Process Visualization (Level 3) gives you both knowledge and experience in FIVE different HMI / SCADA development environments.  By the end, you've created several COMPLETE visualization (screen) projects that you can actually run on your own computer (and SHOW PEOPLE in an interview) with no additional hardware. IEC Paradigms (Level 4) is only for the heavyweights.  This course teaches you how to program using all five IEC programming languages (plus one more) in multiple environments.  There are projects as well, so by the end, you have seen it all and DONE it all as well.  There won't be anything anybody can show you that you won't already be familiar with. TIA Portal Master Project (Level 5) is the culmination of everything. In that course, you'll program an entire power plant using all five PLC programming languages (in PARALLEL!) with a full HMI. It's a massive and complex project that really showcases your talents in an interview!",€19.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-backend-communications-and-protocols/,Fundamentals of Backend Engineering,"Understand backend communication design patterns, protocols, execution and proxying","Backend engineering is an art. During my 18 years career working with and building backend applications, I discovered that certain communication design patterns keep emerging. There are only handful of ways clients communicate with backend applications, although they might be more, I believe the patterns I discuss in this course are the most common. Examples of these patterns are request-response, publish-subscribe, short and long and push. Based on these communication design patterns, engineers may use a number of protocols for concrete communication. While core transport vehicles are limited to either TCP or UDP, tons of industry specific protocols are built on top of these two to address certain problems and use cases. Examples of these high level protocols are HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, gRPC, WebRTC and many more. Other transport protocols like QUIC was built on top of UDP to bring HTTP/2 streaming down at the transport level. Each protocol has its pros and cons and fits certain use cases. In the course, I discuss the top common protocols and provide examples and demos where applicable. Before the client can send a request, it has to establish a connection to the backend. Understanding how the connection is established, and what parts of connection establishment is done at kernel and what parts are done at the backend application process is critical. How the connection is then accepted by the backend application and how it can accept connections as fast as possible so the kernel queue doesn’t get full otherwise clients can no longer connect. After the connection is established the client sends the request, but what happens exactly in the backend application to read the request? What exactly is a request? Understanding the cost of parsing a request based on the protocol makes the engineer appreciate the work done and equip her with better tools to troubleshoot performance problems or bugs. Once the request reaches the backend, the application has to execute the request. The backend has a buffet of design choices when it comes to the style of execution it can choose. Understanding the difference between a process and a thread, multi-process, multi-threaded and the correlation to the number of CPU cores or hardware threads is crucial to pick the right execution pattern. One does not have to stick with these patterns but can invent new ones that suits their needs. This course is designed for engineers who have built backend applications, it is an intermediate — advance level course, certain programming and networking knowledge is required so I recommend taking my fundamentals of network engineering course before taking this course if you don’t have the networking skills. I hope you enjoy this course, and thank you so much for considering it.",€94.99,en_US

Take a look at these student reviews: 5 STARS:  I passed my AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam today, and it was largely due to the study help provided by this course. I started with Amazon's free self-study video series, but there is no way that the information contained in that series would have been enough. I also purchased a video course provided via Udemy, it was very helpful in filling in some details about the terminology in services that AWS offers, it still wouldn't have been enough. These practice exams are exactly what I needed. These practice exams are worded very similarly to what you'll see on the exams, but are not verbatim. In fact, I found the that way these questions are worded lead me to learn more about the technology areas that the exam focuses on, helping ensure a positive result. Also, and this is very important. The instructor(?) is very active in the Q&A area. S/He responds quickly to questions, and provides clear answers, often with links to the material that supports the answer. This is the practice exam series you want! Tracy Norrell 5 STARS:  Yesterday, I passed this exam on my first attempt. This is a great course to pass the cloud practitioner exam. Highly recommended to all. I noticed that all the questions were in the exam was totally covered in this course. Without this material I won't be able to pass my exam. Thank you so much. Waiting for CSA Practice test. Maulik Patel 5 STARS:  1. Buy this course 2 -3 weeks before your AWS-CCP exam. 2. Take one, 65-question quiz every other day. 3. Pass or fail, review your results, read (and research) the explanations. Watch your scores dramatically improve. 4. Repeat the exam/review/retake cycle six times (6-exams) leading up to your proctored exams. 5. You WILL pass the CCP. Best >$50 career spend ever. Lance Johnson 5 STARS:  Excellent practice tests. They are the closest I have found to the real thing. Helped me pass the Practitioners Exam the first time. David Glowacki 5 STARS:  Passed the Cloud Practitioner Exam today on my first attempt and i must say these practice tests really helped me a lot. I only took one week to prepare for the test. Reading the detailed answers and understanding them after each attempt will help you get through the exam easily. I felt that the real exam was a bit tricky but these practice exams will prepare you for that.

Six Sigma is a strategically designed set of tools and techniques that help improve business processes within an organization. The primary goal of Six Sigma certification is to validate individuals (like you) who possess the skills to identify variations, defects, or errors in a business process and mitigate or eliminate them.  The Six Sigma Certification comes in various skill levels: Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, and Master Black Belt. These certifications can be obtained through an accreditation body like Advanced Innovation Group Pro Excellence (AIGPE) which trains and certifies professionals in 176+ countries. These certifications also help you become a specialist in process improvement and will enhance your career's standard and credibility.  What is Six Sigma Green Belt Certification? Six Sigma Green Belt is a certification course wherein you will receive a hands-on understanding of 100+ tools and techniques. These methods are essential for participating in DMAIC improvement projects. DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control. These are the 5 Phases of a Six Sigma Improvement project. This is the only course that teaches these 5 Phases in 15 structured steps helping you understand the entire methodology in thorough detail. By taking up this certification course, professionals (like you) can identify the problems and implement solutions to eradicate them. What are the Benefits of Six Sigma? Six Sigma helps your organization reduce variation and eliminate errors An organization has several business processes. Each business process has its own unique set of procedures followed by individuals working in that business. Acquiring Six Sigma certification enables YOU to become crucial to your organization's ability to identify and eliminate variation and repeatable process errors.  With a Six Sigma certification, you can help to transform and enable your organization to increase revenue by identifying and eliminating errors that would otherwise have brought poor customer satisfaction and losses to the business. Certified Six Sigma professionals can help reduce variation, errors, customer complaints, cycle time, cost, schedule delays and spending/revenue leakages. For example: Between 1986 and 2001, Motorola saved 16 billion dollars using the Six Sigma methodology and General Electric (GE) saved 4.4 billion dollars between 1996 and 1999.  Improve your business and sustain the gains Once you attain the Six Sigma certification, you'll be able to prove you have the knowledge to identify gaps in an organization's business process and you will be able to measure, analyze and improve those gaps. You will also have the ability to conduct complete review of the current process and gain a very clear understanding of their impact on the output. You'll also develop the ability to achieve exceptional improvements in your business and sustain them by monitoring processes closely to ensure there is little or no deviation from the mean and taking corrective measures to improve your implemented actions. Six Sigma is applicable across industries What is the value of Six Sigma certification? As an industry independent methodology, Six Sigma techniques are applied in aerospace, electronics, telecom, banking and finance, IT, HR, marketing, and many more industries. Getting a Six Sigma certification can lead to better job opportunities and improved salary - even though its not easy to attain. One of the reasons Six Sigma professionals get so much respect is that the practical applications of Six Sigma tools and techniques require creative and out-of-the-box thinking - and executives and hiring managers at major companies are well aware.  With a Six Sigma certification, you will be able to position yourself as a change agent within the organization, spearheading quality improvement throughout your team or organization, showcasing your leadership skillset. When you get certified in Six Sigma, you become knowledgeable in dozens of different methods to streamline business processes, improve employee acceptance, reduce costs, and increase revenue - all of which lead to better bottom line, no matter the industry.

Ensure Compliance With the stringent quality standards of Six Sigma, manufacturing and service errors are reduced to less than mediocre figures. This has meant that a number of vendors, procurers, and oversight organizations apply Six Sigma standards when evaluating products or accounts. As a certified Six Sigma professional, you will be able to help your organization comply with international standards, as well as maintain profitable contracts. Improve Your Managerial and Leadership Ability Six Sigma training also prepares you for leadership roles, with the techniques and knowhow to cut costs, increase revenue, and ways to improve the efficiency of the business process. Those who achieve Six Sigma Green Belt are not only educated on the methodologies of Six Sigma, they are also prepared to become a change agent within their organization, leading efforts to improve processes and the quality of products and services delivered to customers. Once you complete your Six Sigma course and obtain your certification, you will have a clear understanding of measuring and quantifying financial benefits from executing any Six Sigma project.

https://www.udemy.com/course/code-dynamic-websites/,Practical PHP: Master the Basics and Code Dynamic Websites,Code Your Very Own Dynamic Websites by Learning PHP Through Real-World Application & Examples,"Learn How to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP 5+  for absolute beginners!    This course is a total beginners guide to coding dynamic websites with PHP so you need  no prior knowledge or experience with PHP —  although, it is a good idea if you know  some  HTML & CSS.  (My beginner's guide Build a Website from Scratch with HTML & CSS will teach you everything you need to know about HTML & CSS.)    Practical Hands-on Approach    My approach with this course, like many of my courses, is to take a practical ""hands on"" approach. While there will be some theory involved — every single lesson requires you to get your hands dirty and exercise what you've learned in that specific lesson. I find this to be the best approach, because you're able to retain much more of what you learned, and therefore, get up and running with maximizing your practical knowledge of PHP quickly!   Why Should I Learn PHP?    So — why learn PHP? Well, PHP is a very powerful scripting language used by millions of websites. Some of the most popular websites and frameworks utilize PHP to build their dynamic websites. PHP works very well with HTML, and therefore will allow you to start coding dynamic websites quickly without having to learn some of the more complicated scripting languages out there.   You Will Love This Course    I think you're going to love this course, and you're going to especially love what you're going to learn. When I first started learning PHP, I  couldn't wait  to start implementing what I learned into my websites! I think you'll feel the same.   It's Totally Free!    Also, I am excited to be offering this course  absolutely free  for three reasons:   I don't want a purchasing decision to get in the way of you learning what I have to offer in this course. I want as many people as possible to be able access the content. I want to give you learning material so good that it  should  cost money. The Final Project    Throughout the course you will be building a handful of dynamic PHP examples, but in the last section of the course, we will build a dynamic website for a (fictional) restaurant.   So, I invite you to join me in learning how to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP!   Let's do this.",Free,en_US

Or perhaps make your own game? But don't how to go about it or where to even start? If so, you may be looking around for cheap (and hopefully free) 3D software.   Blender is one such tool. It is a free, open-source 3D software that can do everything from 3D modeling, animation, rendering and game development. The tool continues to grow with newer and more awesome features being added every so often. Their current feature set is packed and rivals the most expensive 3D software today. One would have to see the awesome projects and quality renderings created by people who have not spent a cent.   In this course, you will learn the basics of (nearly) everything in Blender. Without needing to invest a whole lot of time or money, you will learn how to get started with 3D modeling, lighting, animation, sculpting, rendering, and physics to name a few with exercises spread throughout so that you can get your first experience with the software and gain overall confidence along the way. You will be one step closer to mastering Blender.   What's in this course?   The course is aimed to provide a gentle, yet thorough, introduction to Blender 3D so that you will go away with the confidence of working on your own dream projects. We won't just be looking at what each control does and call it done. The course provides a number of exercises (or mini-projects) on all the main components of 3D of which you are strongly encouraged to follow along and get your first experience with Blender.    Specifically,   You will learn how to navigate through Blender and get comfortable with the user interface. You will learn the bare basics of 3D modeling, lighting, animation, materials, texturing, rendering, sculpting, particles and physics. You will work on small easy-to-follow exercises to help solidify your learning and gain your first experiences making something with Blender. You can ask me for help anytime if you get stuck trying to do something.   By the end of this course, you will have completed your first few mini-projects with Blender. Since we cover nearly everything in Blender, this will raise your confidence   With over 60+ lectures, there is so much to learn. Don't let this overwhelm you though. The course is designed to make the learning curve as smooth and as easy as possible so that you don't have to pull out all your hair in frustration in an attempt to learn Blender on your own.

There are no nasty jargon anywhere in this course and everything will be explained in a simple easy-to-understand manner.   You are not expected to know anything about Blender. You can start this course with no prerequisites (as we'll cover how to download and install Blender). If there was one prerequisite, it would be to have some passion for 3D (or whichever project you would need Blender for). That motivation will help push you to master Blender so that your dream movie or game can come to life.   What is the expected outcome after the course?   By the end of the course, you can expect to have a good understanding of the major components of Blender. You will gain experience and hopefully confidence in being able to pull off your own 3D projects without having to pull out your hair in frustration.   After that, the outcomes are endless. As you continue to work on your projects, you start to gain confidence in learning more advanced stuff. At this stage, making movies and/or game projects becomes a thing of reality. You could even meet one of the requirements for a Blender-related job!

https://www.udemy.com/course/developer-to-architect/,Software Architecture & Technology of Large-Scale Systems,"Learn Architecting Software Systems with High Performance, Scalability, Availability, Security using Modern Technologies","Architecting software systems is a skill that is in huge demand, but it is not a readily available skill. To understand why this skill is rare to find, let's go through a few lines from Martin Fowler's blog on architecture. He says:  Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is . It means that the heart of thinking architecturally about software is to decide what is important, (i.e. what is architectural), and then expend energy on keeping those architectural elements in good condition.  For a developer to become an architect, they need to be able to recognize what elements are important, recognizing what elements are likely to result in serious problems should they not be controlled. It takes a number of years for a developer to learn enough to become an architect. This learning largely depends on the kind of opportunities that you get in your career. Often these opportunities are limited to specific areas of work only.  However, to be an architect, you must possess extensive technical knowledge of as many areas as possible. You must understand all the complexities and challenges in different parts of a system. You need the ability to make upfront decisions by understanding various trade-offs. You should be able to foresee or anticipate critical problems that a system can face during its evolution. This is where the 'Developer To Architect' course can be very useful for you. It assumes that you already have great development skills, and it builds from there. It extensively covers architecting non-functional properties of a system, handling of large-scale deployments, and internal working of popular open-source products for building software solutions.  To give you some details of what is specifically covered: Architecting non-functional properties like Performance, Scalability, Reliability, Security.   Large-scale deployment and operations using Docker containers and Kubernetes. Internal working of popular open-source products like Node.js, Redis, Kafka, Cassandra, ELK stack, Hadoop, etc for confidently architecting software solutions.  In short, this course will help you learn everything you need to become a 'true' architect in a very short period of time.",€94.99,en_US

Update 1: Eclipse IDE setup for ARM Cortex M based MCUs added The course is designed for beginners to advanced audiences. Brief Description: This course Demystifies the internal working of the Microcontroller and its Peripherals. Coding for the Peripherals STEP-BY-STEP and Developing software drivers entirely from scratch by extracting maximum information from Datasheets, Reference manuals, specs, etc Protocol Decoding Using logic analyzers, Debugging, Testing along with Hints and Tips. Long Description: Learning Embedded System Programming can be a challenge. Since it's a relatively complex field, there's no actual gold standard yet for how things are practiced, or taught, which can frustrate people who are just trying to learn new things and couldn't connect the dots. This is the motivation behind creating this course to help engineers and students learn different aspects of embedded systems by providing high-quality advanced lectures at a relatively low price. Master Behind the Scene working; created this course because I believe your time is precious, and you shouldn't have to hunt around to get a practical foundation In Embedded System Programming. In this course, you will learn to write your peripheral driver for most commonly used peripherals such as GPIOs, I2C, SPI, USART, etc., and the exciting thing is that you will learn everything from scratch. No 3rd party libraries! No blind coding! Write your driver APIs by dealing with the peripheral registers of the MCU! Code and Implement APIs from scratch, diving into the datasheet and reference manual of the MCU. I will thoroughly explain how to extract the maximum information from datasheets, Technical Reference manuals to configure and handle peripherals. These techniques you can go and apply to any MCUs you have at your hand. In this course, I will walk you through step-by-step procedures on configuring various Peripherals like GPIOs, SPI, USART, I2C by taking you into the reference manual and datasheet. We will develop a fully working driver code, interrupt handlers, sample application everything from scratch to understand the big picture. In each lecture, I assure you that you will learn something new to use in your work or projects. You'll find yourself handling these peripherals with much more clarity. You will be able to speculate and debug the problem quickly. I'll show you tricks and tips to debug the most common issues using debugging tools such as logic analyzers. This is not the Arduino style of programming: I believe Arduino is for quick prototyping of projects/products but not for mastering the working of micro-controllers and their peripherals. Unlike Arduino programming, where you develop a quick solution and prototyping of products using third-party libraries, this course is entirely different. In this course, no 3rd party libraries are used. Everything we will code by referring to the technical reference manual of the MCU and will create our own library. The Power of this approach is that you can quickly speculate problems and debug like a pro when things go wrong in your project due to bugs. If one thing me and my students are good at is ""debugging,."" To achieve good debugging skills, it's essential to code by understanding how things work behind the scene but not by blindly using some third-party libraries, and that's the biggest TAKE away from this course. The course is designed and explained so that it is generic across any microcontroller. The code we develop can be used as templates to quickly build a peripheral driver for your MCUs on-chip peripherals. Software/Hardware used: In this course, the code is developed so that it can be ported to any MCU you have at your hand. If you need any help porting these codes to different MCUs, you can always reach out to me! The course is strictly not bound to any 1 type of MCU. So, if you already have any Development board that runs with an ARM-Cortex M3/M4 processor, I recommend you continue using it. But if you don't have any development boards, then check out the below Development boards. 1. STM32F407xx based Discovery board ( This is the board used in this course) MCU Vendor: STMicroelectronics IDE: STM32CUBEIDE (Free) My promise: I am confident that this course will save you many hours of studying/experimenting/googling time to learn about MCU programming. I will personally answer your questions about this material, either privately or in a group discussion. If you are not satisfied, for any reason, you can get a full refund from Udemy within 30 days.

https://www.udemy.com/course/price-action-strategy/,Master Price Action! Complete Day Trading Strategy From A-Z,"Complete Day Trading Strategy Suitable for Forex, Indices, Gold and Crypto. Supply & Demand + S/R Indicators Included!","What Will You Get From This Course? Offering a recipe for  improving your trading results , this course gives you a  straightforward price action strategy  and a solid  set of rules for managing risk  like a professional, leaving behind all the noobie mistakes that made you lose money in the past. But Why Is This Course Free? Is it worth the time? I know  you're used to seeing trading courses, seminars, webinars and coaching programs being sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars  all around the Internet. The thing is my goal isn't to make a fortune out of selling educational content to you, since I'm already a successful trader and that alone makes me live a fulfilling life already  (no, I'm not bragging) . The harsh truth about  most ""traders"" selling online courses  for ridiculous amounts of money is that their trading career isn't on the right path and they're trying to make up for it by  turning you into their main source of income . This isn't fair or honest at all, but it's a reality. Ok, But Still, Why Did I Bother Creating This Course? Well, since we got the financial aspect out of the question, I must confess that  one thing that really pisses me off is seeing lots of beginners in trading getting 'rekt' following the dreadful advice of all kinds of Twitter and YouTube ""gurus""  who have literally no idea how markets work, what moves a market, how to properly read a chart or how to manage risk adequately. If you take a look at their pitiful charts, you're immediately overwhelmed by the number of  flashy indicators  and colored lines - all of them making you unconsciously think  ""Wow, this guy is smart and his analysis is so complex! I have to get at his level, fast!"" . And then  you find yourself throwing money at him, just to end up even more confused after joining his training program, weekend seminar or, even worse, his paid signals group . I've made all of these mistakes myself and I'd hate knowing you're going to fall down the same rabbit hole as I did back in the day.  Back to the initial question, my only benefit from you taking this course is the thought that maybe  I'll get to convince you that trading is only as complicated as you make it to be , and that for this reason you don't have to throw away hundreds or thousands of dollars that would be better spent elsewhere. Now, let's get down to the nuts and bolts of this course. What Are We Going To Cover Throughout The Course? Introduction to Price Action trading  - If you're a complete rookie, don't worry! We're gonna recap all the basics to get you on the same page. You're gonna be spoon-fed, the right way. Multi-timeframe analysis is always a must  - You're going to learn the crucial role of analyzing a higher timeframe before diving into scalping and day trading on the lower timeframe charts. Properly identifying and marking key S/R levels  - How you draw your Support & Resistance levels and Demand & Supply Zones is at the core of your strategy. Most probably, you're doing it wrong already! This is where you mess up - Risk Management  - Risk Tolerance, Stop Loss, Position Sizing - all are mandatory. You're gonna become a Risk Manager first, and then a Trader. Noobs usually skip this. TradingView S/R and Demand & Supply Zone private indicator  - With time you're gonna develop a sharp eye for spotting key areas on your chart, but this TW indicator will do your job for now. Again, spoon-feeding you. MetaTrader5 S/R and Demand & Supply Zone expert advisor  - MT5 user? This EA will calculate and draw all the relevant Support & Resistance levels, as well as help you identify Demand & Supply zones. Ok, But Who Am I? I am Mike, a  forex ,  indices and cryptocurrency trader  who went through all the trading mistakes you can imagine,  bought tons of TA books , attended lots of webinars and live trading seminars,  tried hundreds of useless indicators  (and tweaking every little setting and parameter for each of them), before realizing that pure  Price Action and solid risk management are the keys to profitable trading , along with the right mindset of course. Now, years after I acknowledged and accepted that all of those flashy indicators, alongside reckless risk management and an inconsistent mental approach have been the  entry barriers into the world of consistent trading profits , I managed to synthetize and organize my thoughts, knowledge and experience into an  easy-to-digest and novice-friendly video course , which I'm going to share with you here. Before jumping in, try to discard all the non-sense that your Twitter trading ""guru"" has instilled into your mind.

What an exciting time. It's been nearly 4 years since Tensorflow was released, and the library has evolved to its official second version. Tensorflow is Google's library for  deep learning  and  artificial intelligence . Deep Learning has been responsible for some amazing achievements recently, such as: Generating beautiful, photo-realistic images of people and things that never existed (GANs) Beating world champions in the strategy game Go, and complex video games like CS:GO and Dota 2 (Deep Reinforcement Learning) Self-driving cars (Computer Vision) Speech recognition (e.g. Siri) and machine translation (Natural Language Processing) Even creating videos of people doing and saying things they never did (DeepFakes - a potentially nefarious application of deep learning) Tensorflow is the world's most popular library for deep learning, and it's built by Google, whose parent Alphabet recently became the most cash-rich company in the world (just a few days before I wrote this). It is the library of choice for many companies doing AI and machine learning. In other words, if you want to do deep learning, you gotta know Tensorflow. This course is for beginner-level students all the way up to expert-level students.  How can this be? If you've just taken my free Numpy prerequisite, then you know everything you need to jump right in. We will start with some very basic machine learning models and advance to state of the art concepts. Along the way, you will learn about all of the major deep learning architectures, such as Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (image processing), and Recurrent Neural Networks (sequence data). Current projects include: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Recommender Systems Transfer Learning for Computer Vision Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Deep Reinforcement Learning Stock Trading Bot Even if you've taken all of my previous courses already, you will still learn about how to convert your previous code so that it uses Tensorflow 2.0, and there are all-new and never-before-seen projects in this course such as  time series forecasting  and how to do  stock predictions. This course is designed for students who want to learn fast, but there are also ""in-depth"" sections in case you want to dig a little deeper into the theory (like what is a loss function, and what are the different types of gradient descent approaches). Advanced Tensorflow topics include: Deploying a model with  Tensorflow Serving  (Tensorflow in the cloud) Deploying a model with  Tensorflow Lite  (mobile and embedded applications) Distributed Tensorflow training with  Distribution Strategies Writing your own custom Tensorflow model Converting Tensorflow 1.x code to Tensorflow 2.0 Constants, Variables, and Tensors Eager execution Gradient tape Instructor's Note: This course focuses on  breadth  rather than  depth , with less theory in favor of building more cool stuff. If you are looking for a more theory-dense course, this is not it. Generally, for each of these topics (recommender systems, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, computer vision, GANs, etc.) I already have courses singularly focused on those topics.

This continues to present unique and potentially difficult challenges for people who are used to studying and working in classrooms, libraries, and cafes, and who are now studying at home, possibly by themselves. On the other hand, working from home also provides new opportunities to explore different ways of learning, finding a work/life balance, and having a healthier lifestyle. The purpose of this course is to teach you ten tips that will help you maintain your concentration and productivity while studying and working from home. There are no magic one size fits all solutions, and even strategies that work for you may be less effective over time. I hope some of these tips are useful for you, or at least can inspire you to think about other strategies that might work for you.

https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-for-real-world-data-analysis/,SQL for Data Analysis: Solving real-world problems with data,"A simple & concise mySQL course (applicable to any SQL), perfect for data analysis, data science, business intelligence.","Note on the Short Version of the Course I have launched the course as a free, shortened version. It is an excellent introduction to the basics of handling data. Two points I want you to know: 1. The course so far is an in-depth view on a small & important part of SQL, rather than a light-touch overview of everything. 2. Technically, the full paid version is on the way. But I am finding it very difficult to find the time to complete the lessons (between other projects and work).  Therefore for those who need a comprehensive course now, I'd suggest signing up to a couple of courses now including this one while it's free. That way you can learn now but also enjoy all the additional lessons for free when they arrive. Note on the Communicating Udemy prevents instructors of Free courses from answering any questions from students. Therefore for now I cannot provide any feedback or respond to comments. Summary Forget the dry, old, textbook approach to learning code.  Forget endlessly drilling syntax .  This course puts SQL in context and  gets you solving real-world business problems from Day 1 .  You'll play the role of a data analyst at Australia's largest fictional consumer bank, with a  uniquely rich relational database  at your fingertips. This context brings SQL to life and makes it easier for you to  understand deeply and quickly . With this new approach, you'll be surprised to see that  SQL is fun and simple to learn . My course guarantee is that you'll go from zero to functional SQL coder within the weekend.  Best features in a nutshell In  plain English , with  business context  and  fun analogies  to explain the otherwise dry syntax. Unique database , using a fictional bank relational database with incredibly rich transaction data to keep the course interesting and relevant. Focuses deep on the absolute basics, to get you the  strong foundations  required for a data career. Doesn’t cost money! If you sign up now while it’s free, you have  lifetime free access , even as the course grows and becomes paid. Read on for more detail My story and building the course My SQL learning experience was not ideal. When I started work I hadn’t the slightest idea what data was, let alone the power it brings to those who wield it skillfully. I took probably a year longer than necessary to master the SQL for data analytics. Even though I was practicing everyday on the job, I was slow to understand new concepts and struggled to remember new syntax. Now as a full-time data analytics and insights manager, I have the hindsight to know it should have been much easier. The main ingredients missing for me were: Structure  What is important, what isn't, and why. Context Analogies, interesting examples, and plain English explanations. Bringing it to life!  So I’ve taken what was lacking in my learning experience and build a course around it. Specifically, here’s why my course stands out: Structured We learn what you need for on the job data analysis using SQL, no more less. The topics are covered in an order that makes sense and helps you build on past learning. You understand why each lesson is important, where it sits in the grand scheme of SQL. In context SQL shouldn’t have to be dry or boring, so I have used realistic business problems and analogies. You’ll be playing the role of a data analyst at the largest fictional company in Australia, the Royal Bank of Australia, solving problems to drive sales, improve marketing reach, and manage customers. Knowing why you’re learning the syntax, you’ll learn faster. Hands on/practical You’ll practice writing SQL in every single lesson. We are going to have fun too , investigating cryptocurrency trading among customers, and even learning about Australian animals! Why learn SQL? Most successful companies today are data-driven.  They record every bit of information about their business (e.g. customers, sales). They store that information (called data) in complex databases. And they draw insights from the data to improve their business.  That’s where SQL comes in.  The only way to gather data and transform it into valuable business insights is to combine SQL and a smart analyst like you. It's with SQL that companies know answers all sorts of where do my customers prefer to shop? Who was incorrectly charged fees? Why are sales going down?)  And as you may have noticed in the Promo, SQL is a great skill to build your career Data careers, in data analysis (business analysis), data science, & data visualisation (business intelligence). SQL is needed to actually find and handle data in most organisations. The data handling and management skills learned via SQL are fundamental to understanding data in general, and are useful even if you don't use the SQL language (rare). Access to data can make you powerful in organisations. It's hard to argue with an analyst armed with well-prepped data and a solid numbers-based argument. Marketing, product management, and tech sales:  SQL (and the accompanying data skills) are a great way to stand out in marketing and product. Marketers and product managers propose changes to improve the business. Nowadays, any proposed change needs a strong case to support it.  Data is the foundation of any strong business case. Therefore marketers and product managers with data skills can put together stronger cases, get more initiatives approved, and grow their career faster. Why start with mySQL? mySQL is: Very common, used by major companies and organisations across the world, such as Uber, Netflix, Spotify, and JPMorgan. Free and easy to set up. Similar to other forms of SQL like Microsoft SQL Server, PostGre SQL, Oracle SQL, Teradata SQL.",Free,en_US

Tableau is one of the most requested reporting tools that are requested in the job market, and the ability to being able to use it now could be very useful for your current work, and your next job hunt. We'll download and install for free Tableau Public, which gives you most of the capabilities of the full-cost Tableau Desktop. We'll start by creating our first visualizations (vizzes) and investigate the Tableau interface. We'll create dashboards and storyboards, so that you can tell a story. We'll create maps, hierarchies, groups and sets, and all sorts of chart types. We'll enhance our charts with reference lines and bands, and extend our data analysis with trends and forecasting. We'll add formula calculations, quick table calculations, and LOD calculations. Finally, we investigate advanced data connections and mapping. The course will take around a little more than 14 hours to complete, but completing this will enable you to create vizzes, dashboards and stories of your own, and know how to overcome common problems. The course increases in difficulty slowly, so you'll create for instance a basic bar chart, then turn it into a stacked bar chart, and adding coloring and information through tooltips and labels, step by step. Please note: Tableau certifications are currently being tested on versions 2020.3 and 2021.1. There have been very few visual additions to later versions, but where there are, they have been reflected in this course with course updates.  The course is fairly relaxed - there will be a few ""wrong turns"", so you can see what problems might arise, but every lesson works towards an end goal at a relatively slow pace, so you can follow on your own computer easily. I assume that you know how to use a computer, including installing programs, but the actual analysis will be at a basic level, and I'll introduce every component as we go on. At the end of the course, you can download a certificate of completion, so you can show everyone your new-found skills, prepare for the official Tableau certifications, and be able to start creating analyses for yourselves.",€114.99,en_US

Are you tired of picking up bits and pieces of information that you can't just seem to put together?   Do you learn best by doing?   If so, you're going to love this course.   One of the biggest complaints I hear from students is that most of the courses they've taken in the past simply provide information without any context and without any idea of how to put that information to use!     This course turns that old, frustrating, and outdated way of learning on its head.     It's project-based, which means instead of learning bits and pieces of information, you'll write actual shell scripts that you can use in real-world situations. You get the chance to immediately put what you learn to use so that you fully understand and remember it.   In this  Linux shell scripting course  you will learn how to:   Name your shell scripts. Use the proper permissions on your shell scripts. Create and use variables in your scripts. Use shell built-in commands and operating system commands. Make the most out of special variables that are available to you in your scripts. Make decisions by using if statements and performing several different kinds of tests Check the exit statuses of commands and why you need to. Use cryptographic hash functions Create random data so you can do things like automatically generate strong passwords for user accounts. Perform the same action or set of actions over a series of data utilizing for loops, while loops, and infinite loops. Control all types of input and output. Accept standard input from a user as well as from another program. Redirect standard output and standard error. Combine standard output and standard error Use command pipelining Perform text and string manipulation. Process command line arguments Creating functions and when to do so.

All the steps to install are on the official Microsoft site, and should be googled for.  URLs and Microsoft offerings are changing on a high frequency as I write this in 2020. The whole process is unfortunately complex. You should register first, then log into the Office portal and finally download and install Project. FAQ: Can I do this course with MS Project XX? ANY which version of MS Project you use, this course will be beneficial to you. I mainly use 2016 standalone (desktop) Project Professional for teaching, but occasionally show the latest UI (only when required). This course teaches logic and techniques universal to all major versions of Project in the market today. There will be about ~10% variation in the UI and minor tweaks, but all the critical logic and techniques will be the same.  FAQ: How to get help with installation? If your office provides Project for you, then seek it from your System Administrator. Else, if you run into issues with the installation, you should seek the help of Microsoft's excellent and live help support system from within the Office portal. And this help is only available through the steps provided in Microsoft's link above. As far as I am aware, this is the only secure and recommended way to get a trial version.  --end of ""how to download ms project""------------------ In case you find the course useless for your career, don't forget you are  covered by a  30 day money back  guarantee, full refund, no questions asked!

Join me  on this incredible journey.  Sign-up Today. Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build  simple, reliable, and efficient software . Go is an amazing choice for a language as it was  developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8  - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax.  Go was created by  luminaries in computer science  at one of the best, if not the very best, software engineering firm to have ever existed - Google. The credentials of Go are unsurpassed. But why did Google create a new language? In Google’s words, “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming; all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.”  In my opinion,  Go is the best programming language that you can be learning today.  I began programming in 1982 with BASIC, I have worked with many languages, and Go is the best language which I have ever used. Go is also  the top-paid programming language in America  today. Come learn about  the greatest programming language ever created . You will leave with resources and code samples to start making all of your software and apps really go.",€34.99,en_US

We will use Photoshop to identify the fonts used in an image and learn how to work with hidden glyphs & ligatures as well as variable & open type fonts. You will master artboards while you are learning how to make easily updatable multiple sized social media & ad banner graphics.  There is a big section on advanced retouching techniques, advanced healing, advanced cloning & patching.  You will learn how to edit videos in Photoshop.

This course will NOT make you a GitLab CI / DevOps expert A lot of courses promise you will become an expert. Becoming an expert in any tool comes with time and hard work. It simply does not make sense to promise something like that. It will not be honest.  This is a course designed for beginners. Learning to build pipelines is a try-and-error process that can be very frustrating. You need to understand the tools you use and how GitLab can support your needs. In the end, GitLab is just a tool.  What I will try is to explain to you the basics and offer you enough practice opportunities so that you can apply what you learn easily in your own projects as well. I will show you how to build pipelines with Gitlab CI.",€39.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-crash-course/,Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!,"A quick, fun, and hands-on introduction to web development. Build a complete app with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React!","*** Just released in December 2022 *** ""I have already learned more in this class than in a $12,000 coding BootCamp (...). Before taking one of the Bootcamp on Udemy, you should take this class first""  – Robert Do you want to learn the fundamentals of modern web development  fast ? Do you want to find out if building websites and apps is the  right career path  for you? Or maybe you just want to know what your web developer friends do all day? In any of these cases... Welcome to my ""Web Development Crash Course""! Together, we will build a fun, small, but full-stack web application in just a few days. But why this course? And why is it so short? Well, there are so many 60 and 80-hour-long ""complete"" web development courses out there, which are great if you want to invest 3 months of your life into finding out if web dev is even right for you or not... I wanted to offer a different approach.  A short and fast crash course, where you can dip your toes into the world of  HTML ,  CSS ,  JavaScript , and even  React  (the most used JavaScript library in the world). You can finish it in a weekend (if you have nothing else planned), or you can take a week. But the point is that  you can learn the very fundamentals of web development quite fast , and in an engaging, 99% project-based way. And even though this is called a ""crash course"",  this course teaches you more in 12 hours than I learned in my first 2 years  as a web developer! That's how condensed, and how valuable, the material is. And the course still maintains the  high-quality standard  of all my other courses, so that you actually understand what you are learning! But you might be thinking: ""Is a crash course really right for me?"" Well, it all depends on your goals. Sure, you will not become a web developer after this short course, and you will not be able to build big web projects (but sometimes that's true even for those huge 80-hour courses). But, at the end of this course, you will have  learned and understood the fundamentals of the most important web technologies  (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React). And even more importantly, you will have  discovered if you actually like web development  and want to pursue it as a (lucrative) career! Plus, you will walk away from this course with a super cool web application that you can show to all your friends (please tell them I sent you ;) All this will enable you to go deeper into the topics that you actually liked, and keep learning and progressing on your own if you like (or of course, you can purchase more specialized courses). So, have you never written a single line of code in your life? You have come to the right place!  We will start slowly, step-by-step , and then speed up the pace as we progress through the course. So here's what we're gonna do in this course: We will set up your code editor and coding environment together (all for free!) I will guide you through the basics of the web and web development Then we slowly start our project, by writing the HTML code (for the page content) We then style the page and create a layout using CSS Next we create an online database and API for our application data, using a free service called Supabase To get the data into the application and make it interactive, we learn the fundamentals of JavaScript Writing apps with only JavaScript can be difficult, so we build the app using the React library Finally, we deploy the final project to a free service called Netlify DONE! You can now share the URL of your project with everyone :) Already know HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? No problem! You can still get something from the course. For example, you can watch only the section on  ""React""  and use the downloadable code from the previous section as your starting point. If all this sounds great, then join me on this adventure right now! See you on the inside :)",€94.99,en_US

This game development course is beginner friendly but you should have some basic knowledge of Blender before watching. This course will teach you a lot of different hard surface modeling techniques and modeling tools including beveling, subsurf modeling, and non-destructive modifier methods. It'll take you from setting up a reference photo in the background to completing a high quality, high resolution, 3d knife model for games. The course starts off by taking you through creating the high-poly model of the knife that we'll later use for baking normal maps onto a low-poly, game-ready model. To prepare our model for texturing I'll walk you through taking our low-poly knife model and UV unwrapping it in Blender. You'll learn how to specify how objects are unwrapped by manually adding seams to edges, how to modify and work with UVs, and how to look for UV stretching to make sure your textures will be applied without distortion. After we're done UV unwrapping, I'll show you how to bake a normal map for the knife using Blender in order to make our efficient low-poly knife look more detailed and high resolution. Whether you want to use this knife inside Blender or export it for a game engine like Unity or Unreal, I'll show you how to make sure your model and its normal map look right in all software. Then finally we'll pull our knife model into Substance Painter and Texture it. I'll show you how to bake normal maps in Substance Painter too, as they tend to come out a little bit better than in Blender. So then you'll know how baking works in both software. We'll use edge wear generators, smart materials, and other tools in Substance Painter to achieve the final look, and then I'll show you how to render your final knife in Substance Painter. I'll also show you how to export your textures so they can be used in programs like Blender or others.",Free,en_US

You can learn real-world IT skills that you can immediately start using once you land an IT job. Plus, we provide hands-on labs. The best way to learn technology is just to do it. So, you are actually practicing what you learn as you learn it. In this information course, you will learn key tips to start an IT Career. Jobskillshare focuses exclusively on training you for the job skills required to get started in a technology career. The goal of 2–4-year schools is generally to provide a well-rounded education. That’s why traditional colleges and community colleges require that almost 50% of your classes are in “general education,” – which may or may not help you advance your career goals. By teaching only, the technology job skills you need, jobskillshare is able to “accelerate” your education time frame and ensure that the technology you are learning is not outdated.  In today’s economy where the demand for skilled IT workers significantly exceeds the supply of qualified candidates, most employers are more interested in whether or not you can do the job than whether you have a degree. According to recent Census data, only 38% of web developers have a four-year degree. In a survey of 2400 CIO’s by Robert Half Technology, 71% said they place more emphasis on “skills and experience than on whether or not a candidate attended college/university”. While there are still some companies and some positions that require a degree, the vast majority of job opportunities do not. These opportunities are being filled with individuals with the right technology job skills. We teach you what you need to know for your new career in IT, even if you’re just starting out! For our students at Jobskillshare, we offer a unique, in-depth program designed to prepare you for a rewarding career in IT Whether you’re a beginner looking for a career change or you’ve got a tech background and want to take your knowledge to the next level, we have the program designed to make it happen.",Free,en_US
https://www.udemy.com/course/introvert-confidence/,Social Confidence for Introverts,Enhance your social skills and see instant results,"Are you an introvert who lacks the confidence and communication tools that allow you to enjoy socializing and networking?

Have other confidence programs and “gurus” left you feeling shortchanged or offered only short-term relief? Welcome to  Social Confidence for Introverts , the unrivaled personal-transformation program created by Norway’s most high-profile “social coach,” TJ Guttormsen.

Thank you so much for this wonderful experience.""  - JAYSHREE VYKUNTAM, UDEMY STUDENT With more than 100 national media appearances to date, TJ’s expertise on the subject of social confidence is widely sought after by television, radio, newspaper and magazine reporters. Over the past decade, TJ has shared the stage with many celebrated self-help experts and change-work practitioners. He has also published books, produced courses, taught workshops and performed 1-to-1 coaching with astoundingly powerful results that have surprised the industry.

""This course has put the concept of 'introvert' into perspective for me so that I don't see it as negative or a problem that I have anymore. I'm so happy I took this course because now I know how to nurture myself properly to re-energize and gain understanding from others without feeling bad.  TJ has given me some great conversation techniques and ways to move from self doubt to action. All for FREE!

So to wrap it up, if there were 10 point to give, I'd give it a 12!!!""  - CLAUDIA TOMASCHECK, UDEMY STUDENT ""A real eye opener I love how you broke it down. I now understand why I react a certain way compared to my extrovert friends. This will help me move out of my comfort zone and grow as an individual. Thanks so much.""  - CAROLE RAMOS, UDEMY STUDENT By unmasking the dark psychological programming holding most introverts back, the program is designed to quickly and dramatically upgrade your self-confidence, revolutionize your relationships and enhance how others perceive you. Inside you will discover the  three pillars  of social confidence: 1. A solid grasp of how your own mind works 2. A deep understanding of other people’s thoughts and emotions 3. The art of connecting instantly and communicating brilliantly In just under two hours, you’ll discover everything there is to know about becoming a socially confident introvert. You’ll master social situations in an entirely new way that blasts through many of the psychological, interpersonal and communication challenges that hold most introverts back. You’ll learn: —How to bypass small talk and create conversations you actually enjoy with people you naturally click with. —How to create and maintain friendly networks of people who’ll support rather than pressure, discourage or limit you. —How to go outside of your comfort zone at an easy, manageable pace. —How to avoid recklessly venturing into the “panic zone” that drives introverts back to square one. —How to identify people you truly want to know rather than those you feel obligated to befriend, or who needn't matter. —How to say “no” without being wracked by unnecessary guilt or shame. —How to be authentically comfortable in  any  type of social situation. —How to help others understand  you  better. ""TJ is a great communicator and teacher. The course is clear and covers all the essentials to make quick improvements in confidence. I would recommend for introverts as well as others whom want to make improvements in their conversational skills. Thanks TJ""  - JENNA L, UDEMY STUDENT ""The teacher truly engages you to keep up with the content and the tips he gives throughout the course are incredibly useful and straight to the point. A lot to learn in just a few hours of content. Just an amazing course!""  - SERGIO GUSTAVO SÁNCHEZ LINARES, UDEMY STUDENT Consistent and reliable results The program’s focus is on consistent and reliable results—not the boom-and-bust approach of too many fly-by-night personal-change gurus. First off, you’ll get to understand how the introverted mind really works—so you can begin working with rather than against it. Second, you’ll discover how to become more at ease in social situations by gaining a truer understanding of how others think, feel and function. Finally, you’ll learn the  three simple secrets  to creating exactly the kind of conversations you want, enabling you effortlessly to bridge the gap between your mind and those of others. Even just an intellectual understanding of the groundbreaking psychology TJ shares in this program could generate instant results for you. However, combining this understanding with the simple tasks and techniques he recommends will likely lead to permanent and impressive changes faster than you imagined possible. People already comfortable in their own skin may also benefit from taking this course—for instance, if they want to understand social psychology better, such as the differences between introvert and extrovert minds. How often have you missed out on beautiful relationships because the self-talk in your mind held you back? How many professional opportunities have you forfeited because somebody else used their talkativeness to steal all the attention? How many conversations have drained you of energy simply because you didn’t know how to change them for the better? After taking this course, you’ll likely never have to face any of those frustrating and debilitating scenarios ever again. "" This is not your average free course. It is packed with useful tips and strategies that I have already started to implement in my life. I can see how this will take me to the next level in my career too. I look forward to doing more of TJ's courses and based on this one have already purchased 2 more. ""  - ALAN BROWN, UDEMY STUDENT ""TJ has a unique ability to teach in an engaging way, and his courses are structured so that the content becomes easy to understand and learn. This ensures that anyone taking his course will be in great hands.""  - LILLIAN RYDNING, PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR This free program will also teach you: Self-Mastery… —How to manage and understand your emotions better than ever before. —How to live in your “growth zone,” where true confidence is built. —How to identify and eradicate forever that self-doubting, self-critical voice in your head. —How to put the introvert’s “low-energy charisma” to best use. —How to recharge your “social energy” more quickly and keep it in place for longer.

https://www.udemy.com/course/crash-course-electronics-and-pcb-design/,Crash Course Electronics and PCB Design,Learn Electronics and PCB Design from the Ground up with Altium CircuitMaker and Labcenter Proteus,"Crash Course Electronics was designed for one thing -- to take you from mystery to mastery in Electronics and PCB Design. This massive course was custom made for those interested in learning electronics from the ground up that wish to leverage that knowledge to build actual printed circuit boards (PCBs). There is no other course like this in existence that has the depth and breadth of Crash Course Electronics. The course starts with atomic physics and the electron, before you know it you are learning Ohm's Law, circuit analysis, AC, DC, complex impedance, RC and RL circuits,  filters, amplifiers, transistors, FETs,  analog and digital theory -- too much to list here!  But, unlike other courses that are highly technical and math based. Crash Course Electronics was designed to be taken as a journey with the instructor. Each lecture building on the last, each new concept like a new puzzle approached in many different ways. The most complex topics and mathematical concepts are distilled down into understandable lectures and we have a lot of fun doing it! I had to learn this stuff at one point and remember how hard it was, so I approach each lecture as if we are both learning for the first time and make no assumptions about what you know or don't know.   As we progress through the lectures, expect to see every circuit and idea worked out on the black board, virtually simulated (with Labcenter Proteus), and built by hand right in front of your eyes in high def, ultra clean video and audio. Not only will you learn all the theory and practical aspects of Electrical Engineering, but my 35+ years of experience with electronics will be downloaded to your brain with countless real-world tips and tricks that will take you from a hobbyist to a deep understanding of the subject matter.    Then when we have all the basic electronic theory under our belts, buckle in for something you have never seen -- we will build, not one, not two, but three complete products! We will talk about the design, the motivation, look up parts, background information, and then design the circuits together like colleagues, lay them out in Altium CircuitMaker, route them, verify and produce manufacturing files. If that wasn't enough, we will take those files and go out on internet and send them to a number of online manufactures and get them ready for production, all you have to do is hit SUBMIT!   Last, but not least -- the course is based on my college text book ""Design Your Own Video Game Console"" aka ""The Black Art of Video Game Console Design"" -- this 800+ page book is included free of charge (the PDF version) with the course. Although, we won't be talking about game consoles in this course, we will be using the text for its theory, electrical engineering and PCB design chapters.",€109.99,en_US

Students also have the option to apply for  free , optional,  extra Lean Six Sigma  examination and certification. This external, free and optional examination/certification occurs outside the Udemy platform, requires registration (name, email and a link to your relevant Udemy certificate) and is offered by SSAA (Six Sigma Academy Amsterdam) which is an independent, academic-run training and certification institute.  LEAN SIX SIGMA Lean Six Sigma is a decades old methodology. Without going into too much detail, you can summarize the goal of lean six sigma as: Reducing non value adding activities and thereby cutting costs, as well as improving quality by eliminating unwanted deviations from norms. These are goals that we strive for in pretty much every single sector and for that reason Lean Six Sigma is useful in every sector such as for instance the IT sector, health care, manufacturing, banking etc. The mastery of Lean Six Sigma is shown in belt colors. The classic sequence of belts is Lean Six Sigma white belt, followed by Lean Six Sigma yellow belt, Lean Six Sigma green belt and Lean Six Sigma black belt. Lean Six Sigma professionals have a very concrete set of skills. This set of skills has proven to be extremely useful when improving quality and consistency and reducing costs. It’s great for process improvement. This is the reason why Lean Six Sigma professionals are in high demand in all fields. It’s best if you convince yourself by actually having a look on the internet at job vacancies and associated earnings. Please note that unlike some other subjects, Lean Six Sigma does not have a universally agreed upon body of knowledge, or a universally agreed upon training and certification procedure. We are very open about this issue, because it should be known by every prospective Lean Six Sigma student. Make an informed decision by reviewing your (employer’s) Lean Six Sigma needs/expectations and compare that with what various Lean Six Sigma training institutes are offering in terms of training and certification and subsequently choose the training and certification that best meets those needs. OUR LEAN SIX SIGMA WHITE + LEAN SIX SIGMA YELLOW BELT CERTIFICATION COURSE We are offering two Lean Six Sigma courses in one, namely the certified Lean Six Sigma white belt + certified Lean Six Sigma yellow belt. In the certified Lean Six Sigma white belt course you will learn the following: You will see an  actual Lean Six Sigma project that we performed  some years ago. We will share our experiences about that project with you. This gives you a broad Lean Six Sigma helicopter view. Our experience shows that students appreciate this helicopter view. You will learn the  essential goal of Lean Six Sigma . You will learn the  various roles in the Lean Six Sigma  system of hierarchy. You will learn  how Lean Six Sigma compares to some other popular methodologies  such as Scrum or Agile. In the certified Lean Sigma Yellow Belt course you will learn the following: How is  quality measured and defined in Lean Six Sigma ? How can the  7 tools of quality help a Lean Six Sigma practitioner  to improve quality? SIX SIGMA ACADEMY AMSTERDAM Six Sigma academy Amsterdam (SSAA) is an initiative of an international group of university lecturers from Holland who have supervised projects at some of the largest organizations in and outside Holland. The aim was to teach what we already taught offline to university students and make that training more affordable, more accessible, more convenient, whilst making sure that it was practical, fun and easy to grasp. You do not need a particular set of mathematics or statistics skills to keep up. This Lean Six Sigma training is going to be very accessible for people from various educational backgrounds. The Dutch BKO accreditation is an academic grade type of accreditation which differs from an accreditation that commercial parties offer to training institutes. This type of accreditation can only be obtained by academics. Although it is a Dutch accreditation, our experience shows that it is extremely well received outside Holland as well because of the academic nature.

Course content First, I will guide you through the installation process, ensuring you have installed the correct library and region template. I will be using the UK Metric library and templates but don’t worry if you want to use another. All the processes will be the same and if I use a component from the UK library that isn’t available in your library, I will always suggest one for you. As with BIM, you work solely on one single project, so I have constructed this course in the same way. If you do not have previous experience with Revit or any CAD-based software, don’t worry. I will start off from the beginning building you up to be more than capable of creating your own Revit models. The course will start off by giving a brief introduction to the fundamentals of a building, what BIM is, and then moving onto the basics of Revit; from the terminology that Revit uses to the tools and interface. We will then begin to build on our projects, introducing a new tool and feature as we progress. Adding in the datum elements, such as the levels and grids. Structural components, such as the Structural and Architectural columns Major and Minor Components like the; walls, windows, doors, floors, stairs, ceilings, curtain walls, and roofs. We will then take it to the next level and learn how to create 2D details, how to tag the components, create schedules & legends, material takeoff sheets, create custom materials, and annotation styles, and create render images and video walkthroughs. Projects that we will create: - Single-storey house, - Two-storey house, - Structural frame, - Conceptual mass, - Table & Door families, - Door, wall, and floor tags, - Worksharing model, - Design option layouts, - Phasing project, - Linked projects, - Topography site layout, Then, we will set up our sheets and send them to print. As a recap, I have added 3 quizzes with 68 questions to test your knowledge. This won’t affect your final certificate but will refresh what you have just learned. Once you complete the course, why not test out your new skills by taking the final exam, consisting of 40 questions! Finally, I continually update this course to keep it up to date with the new releases as well as add new videos. I look forward to seeing you in class!",€54.99,en_US
https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/,Fundamentals of Database Engineering,"Learn ACID, Indexing, Partitioning, Sharding, Concurrency control, Replication, DB Engines, Best Practices and More!","Database Engineering is a very interesting sector in software engineering. If you are interested in learning about database engineering you have come to the right place. I have curated this course carefully to discuss the Fundamental concepts of database engineering. This course will not teach you SQL or programming languages, however, it will teach you skillsets and patterns that you can apply in database engineering. A few of the things that you will learn are Indexing, Partitioning, Sharding, Replication, b-trees in-depth indexing, Concurrency control, database engines and security, and much more.  I believe that learning the fundamentals of database engineering will equip you with the necessary means to tackle difficult and challenging problems yourself. I always compare engineering to math, you never memorize specific formulas and equations, you know the basic proves and derive and solve any equation one throws at you. Database engineering is similar, you can't possibly say MongoDB is better than MySQL or Postgres is better than Oracle. Instead, you learn your use case and by understanding how each database platform does its own trade-offs you will be able to make optimal decisions.  One other thing you will learn in this course is the lowest database interface that talks to the OS which is the database engine. Database engines or storage engines or sometimes even called embedded databases is a software library that a database management software uses to store data on disk and do CRUD (create update delete) Embedded means move everything in one software no network client-server. In this video course, I want to go through the few popular database engines, explain the differences between them, and finally, I want to spin up a database and change its engine and show the different features of each engine.

This course is your practical PM companion to the PMBOK.  Based on a quarter century of hands-on experience managing projects from just a few thousand dollars up to $55M, and working in senior roles on projects up to $3B, it explains how to use the proven Project Management Institute (PMI) processes to manage your projects of any size, from any domain, in the simplest and most deeply practical way.  At the end of the course, you will not only understand project management, you will be able to *implement* it as efficiently as we know how.  You will also receive a certificate that bestows on you the credential  Practical Project Manager  with the right to append  PPM  after your name. The course is end-to-end, comprehensive, and divided into more than 200 easy to digest videos of just a few minutes long.  First an overview is provided of all the fundamental concepts.  Then the critically important role of the Project Manager and the keys to team management are described.  Then the essential PM processes are mapped across the project time-line, and the specific actions you need to take at each step are explained in an easy to follow thread.  The use of software tools to support the PM process is explained.  The course is simple, practical, and complete, providing one comprehensive resource with everything you need to become an expert, practical project manager. You will also receive: Professional Example.  A complete set of realistic, professional PM documentation for a $44M project that you can reuse as a model for your own projects, including a Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Requirements Baseline, Work Breakdown Structure, Precedence Diagram, Project Management Plan, Gantt Schedule, Risk Register, and more. Templates.  Microsoft Office templates for nine key PM documents, from Stakeholder Register to Project Plan to Final Report. MS Office Help . The invaluable guide ""Project Planning With MS Office"" that describes how to use Microsoft Office applications as simply as possible to prepare your project scope, schedule, and budget. If you need to manage a project right now, are preparing for a PMI exam, or just want a solid grounding in the PM best practices to enhance your career, this course will really help.  You will also earn 16 Professional Development Units (PDU's). Instructor William Stewart is a PMI certified Project Management Professional (PMP) who has managed projects for more than a quarter century from just a few thousand dollars to $55M, and worked in senior roles on PM teams on projects up to $3B, in the domains of system integration, software, business process, construction, real estate, research, and others.  He has delivered more than 330 live onsite PM courses to more than 3,300 people, on which this course is based.  He has worked for aerospace, government, academia, and founded a software startup.  He has deep experience with project management, risk management, negotiating, systems integration, and software engineering.  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science for discovery of an algorithm that builds multi-dimensional geodesic domes in optimum space and time, which to his knowledge has never been used for anything practical ;-).

This course will teach you dozens and dozens of powerful commands (see the long list at the bottom), but more importantly it gives you the tools the continue to learn new commands and take full control of your machine. The skills you learn in this course will make you a stronger web developer, data scientist, machine learning engineer, game dev, or plain old computer user!  You will feel POWERFUL!! Hi there, my name is Colt Steele. I've spent years leading in-person software engineering bootcamps and have  helped thousands of students change careers .  Online I've taught  over a million students  and have hundreds of thousands o f 5 star ratings and reviews.  This is an  interactive course  full of  exercises  and  fun challenges  that force you to practice the skills you are learning. You'll encounter some of the same assignments and  projects  that my in-person bootcamp students experience.  Learning command after command can be a dreadfully boring experience, but I've tried my best to make this course as exciting and interesting as possible :)   You may roll your eyes at my jokes, but you won't be bored! ============Curriculum: The Short Version============ This course covers a TON.  Here's a short summary of the key points.  Scroll down for a more in-depth explanation. Learn dozens and dozens of  powerful commands  (see the long list below) Understand the  big picture : how ALL commands fit together Build  complex data pipelines  by stringing multiple commands together Master command-line  navigation  and Linux folder structure Create, delete, move, copy , and  rename  files and folders Decipher and manipulate  Unix file permissions Use powerful searching commands like  find, locate , and  grep Master  redirection  of standard input, standard output, and standard error Write your own  custom commands  from scratch! Customize the shell: write your own helpful  aliases , tweak the prompt, etc. Master  Bash expansions  and  substitutions  Automate tedious tasks using  cron  and  cronjobs Edit files directly from the command-line using  nano Master  keyboard shortcuts  to increase your command-line efficiency ============Curriculum: The Long Version============ The course starts with a deep dive into confusing technical terms like  terminal ,  shell ,  kernel ,  Unix ,  Unix-Like ,  GNU ,   Linux , and  Bash . It's important to understand the context and the WHY's around the command line and its history that still impacts our machines today. Then we shift our focus to the general patterns and  structure that all commands follow  including options and arguments. This blueprint we define will inform every single other topic we cover throughout the rest of the course. You'll also learn HOW to learn more about specific commands using the  man ,  help ,  which , and  type  commands. Next, we cover the super-important Linux  folder structure  and learn essential commands for  navigating our machines  including  ls ,  pwd , and  cd . You'll be an expert navigator in no time! From there we learn to  create new files and folders  right from the command line using the commands  touch ,  mkdir , and  file . Next, we dive deep into a special text-editor built right into the command line called  Nano . You'll learn to open and edit files using Nano, master various Nano shortcuts, and even learn how to configure nano's global settings. The next section covers the powerful commands  rm ,  mv , and  cp . You'll learn how to remove individual files and entire directories, move and rename files, and copy files and folders right from the command line.  These are some of the most useful commands you can know! Then we take a quick break to focus on  useful keyboard shortcuts  you can use to improve your  terminal efficiency , before diving into the history command and  history expansion . The next section covers tons of commands that have to do with manipulating file contents, including  less, cat, tac, rev, head, tail, wc , and  sort . Then we cover the three standard streams:  standard input, standard output, and standard error . You'll learn to  redirect  all three streams and take full control over your data. Next we move to my favorite topic:  piping ! In this section you'll learn how to  construct complex and powerful pipelines  by stringing together multiple individual commands. You'll also learn about the  tr  command and the  tee  command along the way. From there we learn to ""speak"" the language of the shell using  Expansion and Substitution . You'll learn the ins and outs of  pathname expansion  using wildcard characters,  tilde expansion , and the super  powerful curly brace expansion . We also cover  arithmetic expansion ,  command substitution , and single and double  quoting . Next up we learn about two commands that help us find files on our machine:  locate  and  find . We pay special attention to the find command and its many fancy options and use-cases. You'll learn how to find files by name, size, timestamps, and more. You'll also learn how to  bulk-edit files using find's exec option  and the  xargs  command. We then shift our focus to the  grep  command. You'll learn how to use grep to recursively search the contents of files and  match complex files using regular expressions . Next, we spend some time discussing the details of  file permissions . You'll learn how to read file attributes and understand read, write, and execute permissions. In the next section, we learn how to alter permissions using commands including  chmod, chown, sudo , and  su . In the next section, we learn how to customize our shell experience. You'll learn to write your own  custom aliases , work with  shell variables , and even create your own fancy prompt. Then we learn how to c reate our own complex commands from scratch  and the basics of bash scripting! By the end you'll be writing and running your own programs. Finally, we learn about the mysterious  cron  daemon. You'll learn the odd-looking cron syntax to set up  your own automated and scheduled cronjobs .  ============THE END============ Whether you have some experience with basic commands or you're a complete beginner, this course will help  take your skills to the next level.   Learning the command-line is one of the rare skills that transcends the typical divisions between web development, data science, machine learning, or any other tech disciplines. If you work with a computer daily, you will benefit from mastering the command-line.  The commands you learn in the course will  change the way you interact with your machin e, giving you all new workflows and strategies and  POWER over your computer!   More importantly, you'll leave this course prepared to conquer ALL the commands that are waiting for you out in the real world and on the job.    =============================== Here's an incomplete list of the commands covered in the course: date cal ncal echo man help which type ls cd pwd touch mkdir nano rm rmdir mv cp cat less tac rev head tail wc sort tr tee locate du find grep xargs chmod sudo su chown addgroup adduser export source crontab tar",€109.99,en_US

Includes testing and deployment!","Authentication/Authorization?  Covered.   Automated Testing?  Yep, it's here!   Production   Deployment?  Of course! Congratulations! You've found the complete guide on how to build enterprise-ready apps with NestJS. NestJS is a backend framework used to create scalable and reliable APIs.  It is a ""battery-included"" framework; it includes tools to handle just about every possible use case, from data persistence, to validation, to config management, to testing, and much, much more.   This course will help you  master  Nest . By the time you complete this course, you will have the confidence to build any app you can imagine. Throughout this course you will build a series of apps with  growing complexity .  We use as few libraries and tools as possible.  Instead, you will write many custom systems to better understand how  every piece of Nest works together .  Each application you build includes discussion on data modeling and persistence. We will first save records in a simple file-based data store (built from scratch) and eventually work our way up to saving data in a production-grade Postgres instance. Testing  is a fundamental topic in Nest. A tremendous amount of functionality in Nest is dedicated to making sure your project is easy to test. This course follows Nest's testing recommendations, and you will write both integration and unit tests to ensure your project is working as expected. Although testing can sometimes be confusing and boring, I have put special care into making sure the  tests   we write are   expressive, fast, and effective .  You will be able to use this knowledge on your own projects, even those that don't use Nest! Typescript  is used throughout this course to make sure we are writing  clean and correct code.  Don't know Typescript? Not a problem! A free appendix is included at the end of the course to get you up to speed on Typescript.  Once you're familiar with it, Typescript will help you catch errors and bugs in your code  before you even run it .  If you've never used Typescript before you are in for a treat :) -------------------------------------- Everything in this course is designed to make your learning process as easy as possible.  At every step, I will teach you  what Nest is doing internally , and help you understand how to twist and bend Nest to better suit your application's needs.   Every single video in the course has an attached ZIP file containing up-to-date code, just in case you ever get stuck. Full-time teaching assistants are standing by to help answer your questions Access private live chat server is included. Live help whenever you need it! -------------------------------------- Here's a  partial  list of the topics included in this course: Securely  deploy  your app to production Write automated  integration and unit tests  to make sure your code is working Build an  authentication system  from scratch to log users in Allow users to perform certain actions with a  permissions system Store and retrieve data with complex queries using  TypeORM Understand how TypeORM handles  data relationships Write  declarative code  using property, method, and parameter decorators Master the concept of  dependency injection  to write reusable code Implement  automatic validation  of incoming requests Format outgoing response data with a  custom DTO system Handle incoming requests and outgoing responses using  Guards  and  Interceptors Segment your code into reusable  Nest Modules Add structure to your database using  migrations I had a tough time learning NestJS .  There are a tremendous number of outdated tutorials around it, the documentation is sometimes unclear, and Nest itself is just plain  hard to understand.   I made this course to save you  time and money  - a course to show you exactly what you need to know about every topic in Nest.  You will find learning Nest to be a  delightful experience  and pick up a tremendous amount of knowledge along the way.

Maybe you have taken other courses on this topic that focus more on teaching how to pass job interview tests (theory) instead of how to make good choices for the programs you develop (implementation).   Or maybe you are ready to move from a junior programming position to a more senior one and need to get skilled in advanced concepts like data structures, and how to apply them to your own projects.   Whatever the reason, if you are looking for a course that focus on the implementations to give you a complete understanding of how things work, then this is the course for you.   This course goes over the theory of how things work, but only to give you what you need to know to understand the implementation covered.    Complete source code is included and available for you to download.   This is a hands-on course!  If you want to try understand things at a deep level, and work on implementations, rather than theory, then again, this is the course for you.   Topics covered:-   Arrays Linked Lists Trees Hashtables Stacks Queues Heaps Sort algorithms Search algorithms   The course also spends more time than most other courses of its kind looking at what’s available in the JDK. Students wanting to understand how things work ""under the hood"" will benefit enormously from this course.   Why learn about data structures and algorithms?   The reality is, the more you learn about data structures and algorithms, the better a programmer you become.   Why?   Because, data structures and algorithms are effectively patterns for solving problems.   You want to add as many of them as you can to your skill-set.  By doing so, you will find you solve more problems, and use the right tools for the job, in a more elegant way.  And you will learn a heap of them in this course.   Why enrolling in this course is the best decision you can make.   Your instructor, Sarah Ettritch has over 25 years’ software development experience and has been working with Java since JDK 1.1.  She has spent many years creating tools used by developers, which required a deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and is perfectly qualified to teach this course.   Most courses focus on giving you the theory of how things work, so that you can take an interview.  Whilst the theory is important, the knowledge of how to implement these data structures and algorithms are of vital importance. This course goes over the theory of how things work, but only to give you what you need to know to understand the implementation covered.   The main focus of the course is to give you a real understanding of how things work under the hood, so that you can apply this to future programming projects.   If you want to actually understand how things work, and be able to take that understanding and apply it to your own programs, then this course is for you.   After completing this course, you will have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms (both the theory, and the implementation). The sooner you sign up for this course, the sooner you will have the skills and knowledge you need to increase your job or consulting opportunities.    Java developers with key skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms are in high demand and get paid extremely well.   If you are ready for that new job promotion or consulting opportunity, it's time to get started.   Why not get started today?    Click the  Signup  button to sign up for the course",€109.99,en_US

All audio files are available for download! << BRAND NEW COURSE LAUNCHED JUNE 2018. Verified up-to-date as of March 2021. Over 28,000 students bought the TOGAF® 9.1 version of this course. This version has been completely redone and re-recorded, based on the latest changes to the standard. If you look at the job listings, developers and architects with TOGAF experience are in high demand.  You can get certified as an enterprise architect with the TOGAF 9.2 certification exam (OG0-091), and this course will teach you what you need to know! It  takes training to become an Enterprise Architect . Much of that comes through on-the-job skills learned working on software projects larger-and-larger in scope. But very definitely there is a very specific way to design software at enterprise scale. The Open Group has defined a standard for this method for almost 10 years now, and over 400 companies and government agencies have been involved in crafting that standard. It is called  TOGAF - The Open Group Architecture Framework . The truth is: This course  helps you become certified in the TOGAF 9.2 specification . Through learning the Architecture Development Method (ADM), you will become better at designing systems. If you already architect software for a living, learning an official enterprise architecture framework such as this takes you to  the next level of your career . You owe it to yourself: If you are a software developer, this is your chance to learn the proper techniques for assessing the requirements of an enterprise, and designing the right solutions for today and tomorrow! While software development is skill any teenager can acquire, and the salaries paid to software developers fall or are frozen, it's those who know the complex skills of designing large software projects that will still be in high demand. Specifically, this course will teach you: The details of the TOGAF 9.2 Foundation exam (OG0-091), including how to book it, and my experiences taking the exam The basic and core skills of the TOGAF framework The Architecture Development Method (ADM), all of the phases, and the key information to know to pass the exam Other topics covered on the exam, including Architecture Governance, Architecture Capacity, Enterprise Continuum, Capability Assessment, and reference frameworks such as TRM and III-RM This course is focused on passing the exam. In-person classes for this same exam costs $2,000 and take 2 days of intensive training. This course aims to bridge the gap between that level of in-person training, and self-study. If you've ever tried to read the TOGAF 9.2 specification or even the official study guides for the exam, you will perhaps agree that they are lengthy and hard to understand. The TOGAF 9.2 spec is  500 pages long . The official study guide is  265 pages . Both are written in that same style that many official specifications are written in - both very precise and extremely lengthy. Watching these lectures, doing the quiz questions, and following up with a reading of the relevant section of the specification will your self-study time by hours, and will give you the confidence to take the exam and get certified at Part 1! So join me: Join over  28,000 students  studying for the TOGAF 9 Part 1 certification test in one of my Udemy courses! Many have taken and passed the exam after taking this course! I am confident that this course will save you many, many hours of studying time compared with just reading the 500-page spec yourself. If you are in any way not satisfied, for any reason, you can  get a full refund from Udemy  within 30 days. No questions asked. But I am confident you won't need to. I stand behind this course 100% and am committed to helping you pass. You won't get that commitment from a book, or from any other TOGAF class on Udemy. I am a TOGAF Certified architect, and a member of the Open Group's Architecture Forum - helping to define the standard going forward. I am using the TOGAF 9.2 specification under a commercial license. TOGAF is a registered trademark of The Open Group in the United States and other countries.

https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-for-accountants-mapping-tables/,Excel for Accountants: Mapping Tables,Automate reporting tasks with a mapping table,"In this course, author and award-winning instructor Jeff Lenning CPA demonstrates the technique featured in his Journal of Accountancy article  The Power of Mapping Tables . If you use Microsoft Excel to generate reports, this course is for you. We discuss the benefits of storing source data in tables, how to use the SUMIFS function to conditionally sum transactions, and how to translate labels with a mapping table.       	  Microsoft introduced tables in Excel 2007, and this feature is a game-changer. If you do not store your data in tables, you are missing out on a simple way to improve the reliability of your workbooks. Converting an ordinary range into a table provides many special benefits, and we'll discuss these special properties in the course.       	  Also with the roll-out of Excel 2007, Microsoft introduced a new worksheet function: SUMIFS. This too is a game-changer. Performing multiple-condition summing in earlier versions of Excel was challenging, and required clever functions such as SUMPRODUCT or array formulas. For many workbooks, these can be replaced with the SUMIFS function. We'll discuss the function's arguments and demonstrate several practical applications.       	  Excel reports often aggregate data. Frequently, the data labels are different than the report labels. For example, the accounting system may export account names, such as Cash or Savings, but the corresponding report labels are financial statement items, such as Cash and Cash Equivalents. When the labels are different, we are prevented from using lookup functions such as VLOOKUP to retrieve values. In this course, we'll demonstrate the mapping table technique which enables our reports to retrieve values from data tables, even when the labels are different.       	  The course includes practice Excel files, corresponding answers files, and a solutions video. The course is structured by topic, and within each topic, there is a PowerPoint discussion, a lecture video that works through the item in Microsoft Excel 2013 for Windows, and sample exercises for you to work hands-on.

Using the module system, we will share code between TypeScript files and compile them to JavaScript. This course includes many videos, as well as links to useful tools like the TypeScript handbook.  This course should take 3-4 hours to complete, as you may wish to pause frequently to try the many code examples provided yourself.

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-dark-web-anonymity-privacy-security-course/,"The Ultimate Dark Web, Anonymity, Privacy & Security Course","Learn how to access & use the dark net and the clear net privately, anonymously and securely","Welcome to the ultimate dark net, privacy, anonymity and security course. With no prior knowledge required this course will take you from a  beginner to advanced  in all of these topics; teaching you how to properly and securely discover data and websites on both the dark web and clear web, access  hidden (onion) services , communicate privately and  anonymously  using instant messages and email, manually use end-to-end encryption to protect your privacy and make it impossible to read even if it gets intercepted, sign and verify files, share files anonymously, transfer funds anonymously using crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Monero and much more! You'll also learn how to do all of this in a secure manner making it very difficult for hackers or other entities to hack you or de-anonymise you, and even if you get hacked these entities won't be able to easily control your system or de-anonymise you. This course is highly practical but won't neglect the theory, first you'll  understand the inner-workings  of each topic and each technique covered, then you'll learn how to apply it in  real-life scenarios  ultimately teaching you how to use the  dark net and the clear net  in a more private, more anonymouse and more secure manner, so by the end of the course you'll be able to combine the skills you learned and use them in any situation that requires more privacy, more anonymity or more security. This course covers four main topics, I chose to cover all of these topics in one course because I think it is very difficult to learn one without the others as they are very related, these main topics are: 1. Anonymity  - anonymity is a state where your identity is unknown, achieving this on the internet is not easy because of the way it is designed, so in this course you'll learn a number of techniques to improve your anonymity, you'll first learn what the TOR network is, understand how it works and how it can significantly improve our anonymity, then you'll learn how to connect to it using the  TOR Browser , using  TAILS  and using  Qubes OS , you'll also learn how configure TOR properly to bypass censorship and connect even if its blocked! 2. Privacy  - Using an anonymising network such as TOR is not enough to stay private and anonymous because the operating systems we use (Windows, OS X, Linux) constantly collect data about us, therefore in this course you'll learn how to use two operating systems designed to be more private, more anonymous and more secure;  TAILS  and  Qubes OS , you'll learn how to install these operating systems on a USB stick so you can use them on any computer without affecting the original operating system and without leaving any traces! There's also a fully section on  encryption  in which you'll learn how the two main types of encryptions work (symmetric and asymmetric), what is  end-to-end encryption  and how to use it to encrypt / decrypt and sign / verify data, this allows you to privately communicate and share any sort of data; whether it is simple text, or files such as images, videos...etc without worrying about it being intercepted. The course also contains a full section on  crypto-currencies , because the payment methods we are used to use are not private and not anonymous, so in this section you'll learn about block chains, crypto-currencies is and how they work, and how to anonymously obtain two crypto currencies;  Bitcoin and Monero  and use them to send / receive funds. 3. Dark Net  - This is the portion on the internet that is not indexed by search engines and require special configuration to access. Using anonymising networks and privacy-focused operating systems are 2 steps in the right direction of becoming more private and more anonymouse but unfortunately it is not enough, the services we use everyday are not private and constantly collect data about us, so the the search engines (Google or Bing), the email provers (ex: Gmail, or Yahoo), the instant messaging platforms (Whatsapp or Skype), the file sharing services (Dropbox or Google Drivet) ....etc all of these services are not private, not anonymouse and can be used to track us and de-anonymise us. Therefore in this course I will teach you how to carry out your normal day-to-day tasks in a more private and anonymous manner, so first I'll teach you how to search for websites and content on both the clear net and on the dark net, then I'll tech you how to  discover hidden services  (onion services) to carry out your normal day-to-day tasks privately and anonymously (such as communicating using emails, or instant messages, file sharing....etc).  4. Security -  All of the above will  drastically enhance your anonymity and privacy  and allow you to access both the dark web and the clear web privately and anonymously, but if you get hacked, the hacker will gain control over your system and therefore will be able to easily bypass whatever anonymity techniques you're using and de-anonymise you, so all of the above is  useless without security . Therefore in this course I will teach you how to do all of the above securely, then at the last section of the course I'll show you how to  take your security to the next level  by dividing your operating system into a number of security domains, these domains are completely isolated and used for different purposes, therefore even if you get hacked only a small portion of your system will be compromised and it would be very difficult for the hacker to compromise the entire system or de-anonymise you. With this course you'll get 24/7 support, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.

It´s the first 100% Data-driven Trading Course! *** MARCH 2023:  Course fully updated and now with an additional Broker: Interactive Brokers (IBKR)*** Did you know that 75% of retail Traders lose money with Day Trading? (some sources say >95%) For me as a Data Scientist and experienced Finance Professional this is not a surprise.  Day Traders typically do not know/follow the five fundamental rules of (Day) Trading. This Course covers them all in detail! 1. Know and understand the Day Trading Business Don´t start Trading if you are not familiar with terms like Bid-Ask Spread, Pips, Leverage, Margin Requirement, Half-Spread Costs, etc. Part 1 of this course is all about  Day Trading A-Z with the Brokers Oanda, Interactive Brokers, and FXCM . It deeply explains the mechanics, terms, and rules of Day Trading (covering Forex, Stocks, Indices, Commodities, Baskets, and more). 2. Use powerful and unique Trading Strategies You need to have a Trading Strategy. Intuition or gut feeling is not a successful strategy in the long run (at least in 99.9% of all cases). Relying on simple Technical Rules doesn´t work either because everyone uses them. You will learn  how to develop more complex and unique Trading Strategies  with Python. We will combine simple and also more complex Technical Indicators and we will also create Machine Learning- and Deep Learning- powered Strategies. The course covers all required coding skills (Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow) from scratch in a very practical manner.   3. Test your Strategies before you invest real money (Backtesting / Forward Testing) Is your Trading Strategy profitable? You should rigorously test your strategy before 'going live'. This course is the  most comprehensive and rigorous Backtesting / Forward Testing course  that you can find. You will learn how to apply Vectorized Backtesting techniques, Iterative Backtesting techniques (event-driven), live Testing with play money, and more. And I will explain the difference between Backtesting and Forward Testing and show you what to use when. The backtesting techniques and frameworks covered in the course can be applied to long-term investment strategies as well!    4. Take into account Trading Costs - it´s all about Trading Costs! ""Trading with zero commissions? Great!""  ... Well, there is still the Bid-Ask-Spread and even if 2 Pips seem to be very low, it isn´t!  The course demonstrates that finding profitable Trading Strategies before Trading Costs is simple. It´s way more challenging to find profitable Strategies after Trading Costs! Learn how to include Trading Costs into your Strategy and into Strategy Backtesting / Forward Testing. And most important: Learn  how you can control and reduce Trading Costs .    5. Automate your Trades Manual Trading is error-prone, time-consuming, and leaves room for emotional decision-making.  This course teaches  how to implement and automate your Trading Strategies  with Python, powerful Broker APIs, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Create your own Trading Bot and fully automate/schedule your trading sessions in the AWS Cloud!  Finally ... this is more than just a course on automated Day Trading: the techniques and frameworks covered  can be applied to long-term investing as well . it´s an in-depth Python Course that goes beyond what you can typically see in other courses.

This course is not part of my deep learning series, so it doesn't contain any hard math - just straight up coding in Python. All the materials for this course are FREE. After a brief discussion about what NLP is and what it can do, we will begin building very useful stuff. The first thing we'll build is a  cipher decryption algorithm . These have applications in warfare and espionage. We will learn how to build and apply several useful NLP tools in this section, namely,  character-level language models (using the Markov principle) , and  genetic algorithms . The second project, where we begin to use more traditional "" machine learning "", is to build a  spam detector . You likely get very little spam these days, compared to say, the early 2000s, because of systems like these. Next we'll build a model for  sentiment analysis  in Python. This is something that allows us to assign a score to a block of text that tells us how positive or negative it is. People have used sentiment analysis on Twitter to  predict the stock market . We'll go over some practical tools and techniques like the NLTK (natural language toolkit) library and latent semantic analysis or LSA. Finally, we end the course by building an  article spinner . This is a very hard problem and even the most popular products out there these days don't get it right. These lectures are designed to just get you started and to give you ideas for how you might improve on them yourself. Once mastered, you can use it as an SEO, or search engine optimization tool.

https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-prerequisites-the-numpy-stack-in-python/,Deep Learning Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python (V2+),"The Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib stack: prep for deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence","Welcome! This is  Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Science Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python . One question or concern I get a lot is that people want to learn deep learning and data science, so they take these courses, but they get left behind because they don’t know enough about the Numpy stack in order to turn those concepts into code. Even if I write the code in full, if you don’t know Numpy, then it’s still very hard to read. This course is designed to remove that obstacle - to show you how to do things in the Numpy stack that are frequently needed in deep learning and data science. So what are those things? Numpy . This forms the basis for everything else.  The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations. The key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array you’d see in a language like Java or C++, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix. That means you can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The most important aspect of Numpy arrays is that they are optimized for speed. So we’re going to do a demo where I prove to you that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than using a Python list. Then we’ll look at some more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems. Pandas.  Pandas is great because it does a lot of things under the hood, which makes your life easier because you then don’t need to code those things manually. Pandas makes working with datasets a lot like R, if you’re familiar with R. The central object in R and Pandas is the DataFrame. We’ll look at how much easier it is to load a dataset using Pandas vs. trying to do it manually. Then we’ll look at some dataframe operations useful in machine learning, like filtering by column, filtering by row, and the apply function. Pandas dataframes will remind you of SQL tables, so if you have an SQL background and you like working with tables then Pandas will be a great next thing to learn about. Since Pandas teaches us how to load data, the next step will be looking at the data. For that we will use  Matplotlib . In this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram. We’ll also look at how to show images using Matplotlib. 99% of the time, you’ll be using some form of the above plots. Scipy . I like to think of Scipy as an addon library to Numpy. Whereas Numpy provides basic building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things. For example, Scipy can do many common statistics calculations, including getting the PDF value, the CDF value, sampling from a distribution, and statistical testing. It has signal processing tools so it can do things like convolution and the Fourier transform. In sum: If you’ve taken a deep learning or machine learning course, and you understand the theory, and you can see the code, but you can’t make the connection between how to turn those algorithms into actual running code, this course is for you. ""If you can't implement it, you don't understand it"" Or as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: ""What I cannot create, I do not understand"". My courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch Other courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-energy-clearing/,The Ultimate Energy Clearing,"Learn how to cleanse, clear and cut negativity out of your life","When people start talking about energy things get pretty convoluted pretty quick. People’s perceptions of what energy looks and feels like can be quite different. Empaths understand energy to be beyond the physical realm, but the average individual might think of energy as it pertains to the electrical system of a house. Both perceptions are true, but both have very different implications. If we look at the energy in the wall or that lights up our smartphone, we probably wouldn’t feel a need to cleanse it because our perception is that it is neutral. The energy powering your appliances and devices is neither good nor bad, but when we start to talk about people and their intentions or motives, we begin to label energy in ways that imply it can be polarized. In this course, which I consider essential, you will know how the energy in which we live and embrace us behaves and how the practice of energy purification is necessary. This course will teach you about purifying places, environments, objects, and people. Just as in the everyday physical world, it is necessary to clean the places where we live and cleanse ourselves. In the same way, it is essential to do the same work from an energetic point of view. This course is essential if you are a holistic practitioner or otherwise operating in the energy field. Anyway, it is beneficial for anyone since it covers topics that most people completely ignore. Energy can have a very negative impact on everyday life if we do not know how to behave and if we do not know how to act. This course will teach you techniques to use immediately for yourself or potential customers. It's easy to implement and cheap but of great impact. This system is very simple to learn and also very simple to apply. What you’ll learn You will learn how energy works and the importance of purification. You will be able to apply the techniques of the course to purify places, objects, and people. You will know different ways of purifying and different tools suitable for this purpose You will be able to apply the techniques both on yourself and on your potential customers.",€39.99,en_US

No1 – As you may know, Apple shared a clear message at the last WWDC developer conference, saying, “The best way to build an app is with Swift and SwiftUI.” That being said, I will focus on adding more fresh content covering many important topics, such as the following new features: Swift Charts ( coming this summer ),  SwiftData ( coming this summer ) Resizable Bottom Sheet,  New NavigationSplitView, NavigationStack, Table for iPadOS,  MultiDatePicker,  Expandable Text Field,  ViewThatFits,  Improved Grid API,  Layout Protocol,  and so on. No2 – I have already started uploading new content about what is new in the SwiftUI 5 framework.  But not only that, but the entire course will also be updated to iOS 17 this year. Old projects will get both refreshed UI design and enhanced features as well. No3 – Every project is compatible with the latest iOS, so if you run the finished project on the latest operating system, then Xcode will compile it.  I would also highlight that Apple did not deprecate previous SwiftUI versions. That said, the latest iteration of SwiftUI 5 is nothing more than some new features and exciting additions on top of the base of SwiftUI 1 – 5 releases.  No4 – We are building applications from scratch with resources made by professionals. Creating the Bestseller SwiftUI Course with high-quality production value takes a lot of time.  This SwiftUI course is already more than 31+ hours long and will be much longer by the end of this year.  No5 – You will experience the ""LEARNING BY DOING"" teaching method during the course-taking.  Having said that, this is a project-based course where 80% are practical activities and only 20% are theories. There is no other instructor in this category I am aware of who provides more free previews than I do, so you can educate yourself about how things are done in this course.

Through an incredible number of exercises, you'll get practical, hands on experience working with realistic datasets.  You will understand how to store, fetch, and update information with a series of powerful commands.   After gaining experience with elementary operations, you will move on to understanding  database design patterns , offering multiple ways to structure your database for efficient data modeling. You'll see many different scenarios with different types of data, and understand the pros and cons to several approaches. This course is  packed  with practice exercises and quizzes. You'll get immediate practice on all of the different topics and features that you learn!  In addition, you'll understand exactly where to use each of these features in real and practical projects. Besides getting practical hands-on experience, you'll also get a behind-the-scenes look at how  PostgreSQL works internally . We'll dive into raw data files, investigating how PostgreSQL stores information on your hard drive bit by bit.  This knowledge is invaluable when it comes time to start tuning your queries for performance.  By having a natural instinct of how PostgreSQL works, you can plan on being able to get every last bit of performance out of your database. Here is a partial list of some of the topics that are covered in this course: Apply  powerful SQL commands  to store, update, and retrieve information Build  relationships between records  using foreign keys between tables Understand PostgreSQL's numerous  data types , and when to use each Assemble reports of business data by using  aggregation pipelines Work with  millions of records  to simulate real production queries Exercise your query logic skills through the use of  sets and sorting operators Compose queries out of smaller reusable units using  subqueries Use different  design patterns  to efficiently model your data See how to divide database objects into  different schemas  to maintain them more easily Validate your data using simple ' check' rules Construct perfect designs for common features such as  'like', 'follow', and 'tag' systems Speed up your queries with  indexes  - you'll see exactly how they work behind the scenes!

DO NOT subscribe if you   - just want a few short techniques, but you don't want to change anything about yourself   - you feel you are too advanced for a beginner's course   - are not really interested   - are not open    - think ""Let's get to the hypnosis part quick"" without wanting to understand why and how you should use it for achieving a lasting change   - you have very narrow and strict expectations of how things should be and it makes you frustrated if things turn out to be different (the subconscious often goes against our expectations, so openness is an absolute prerequisite)   - want instant solutions without investing the time and effort   - are not committed to making a positive change in your thinking   - don't want to know what to use meditation techniques for   - don't want to get a broader view of the spiritual laws   - prefer to blame others instead of being ready for a change   - only want to scratch the surface   - don't want to learn or use gratefulness to propel your success in life   - are not ready for a NOT classic course Super Important: Don't come for a one-click / 1-minute solution.

There are plenty of people who offer super fast and super easy solutions for your life; from how you can get rich in 14-days to how to become enlightened in 5 easy steps.   If you like to think that life is as simple as that, then this course won't help you. This course is about changing ourselves and thus changing our lives, working on our limiting beliefs, setting smart goals, taking responsibility to get the control back from our negative subconscious programming. It requires work.  It requires commitment.  It requires taking the responsibility. It is not a lightning fast method, but a sure one to start living the life that you were born to live.

This is what turns information into KNOWLEDGE.  That’s why I’m including practical, self-hypnosis exercises in my  material. I think it is very important that you LIVE WHAT YOU LEARN, and  not just passively listen to it. This creates deeper understanding,  knowledge, and awareness. And that is already the first step towards  turning tedious everyday life into a miraculous creation.    I will guide you step-by-step through the phases of   Taking RESPONSIBILITY for your life not just intellectually,  but deep from your heart. (If you are already aware of your  responsibility, it’s wonderful. The material helps you gain a further  insight into the process of how you create your reality and to map out  if there are parts left, where you don’t take full responsibility.) As  a next step I’ll help you to make the DECISION intellectually,  emotionally and spiritually, whether to make a fundamental change or not  and what does this imply Step 3. I will help you to set the right OBJECTIVES. Then you will learn the SKILLS you need to boost your power to act   This is a lot to do, but take the toddler-approach to learning:  just think of the enthusiasm and fun they have learning to walk, even  though at that phase it’s a HUGE accomplishment! And they do it  laughing!    As a transforming hypnotist, I live what I teach.    Hypnosis has literally changed my life and me at my very core and if there was  something worth learning, then it was to understand my subconscious,  learn to communicate and cooperate with it. It was a wonderful gift!!!    And I want to share it with you!    What inspires me to do these courses is to help people, like you learn the skills, which enable them  to use their inner power, wisdom, and motivation.    I help them to connect with their inner self, to become spiritually independent so  that they no longer need gurus or constant assistance and guidance. All  they need is within themselves. All they need is to learn to access it.    What do you need?     You need an open mind and readiness to change and a desire to experience your potential.     What will you learn?     understand how to change your life in positive, beneficial ways how to attract success and abundance take responsibility for your current situation and make a decision for your future set smart and motivating objectives understand the basics of the skills you need to boost your actions connect to your Real, Higher Self improve your awareness understand the trance state through which you have access to your subconscious connect to your subconscious mind understand the basic principles of how the subconscious mind works understand the broader aspects of self-hypnosis use suggestions properly and effectively       Is this course for you?

FAQ - Do I need to be a Software Architect to take this course? Absolutely not! A Software Architect is just a title. In fact, many companies don't give this official title to anyone. Most Software Architecture and System Design is done by trusted engineers within the organization. To get this trust from your managers, you need to demonstrate a solid knowledge of Software Architecture and System Design. This is exactly what you will learn in this course. - What is the importance of Software Architecture, and why do I need to learn it? Modern software development of large-scale systems is very complex. Typically it involves many months of work of multiple software engineers. Just like no one would attempt to build a skyscraper without a solid plan and architecture, it is inconceivable to take on a big software project without proper design and an approved Software Architecture. If the Software Architecture of a system is done poorly the project will likely fail. However, if the software architecture is done correctly, it can have an enormous positive impact on many lives and help your organization grow and thrive. - Is there any coding involved in the course? No. Software Architecture is part of the design phase of a large-scale system. Coding is done only when the Software Architecture is finalized. It definitely takes a certain mental leap to realize that coding is only a small part of software engineering. And if the Software Architecture and the design is done correctly, the coding task and everything that comes after it can be very easy and straightforward. On the other hand, if the Software Architecture is not done correctly, the implementation phase can become a big challenge. - Should any Software Engineer aspire to become a Software Architect? Yes and No. As you gain more experience you will be expected to do more Software Architecture and Design. A role of a Senior Software Engineer in most organizations requires Software Architecture skills, even if your role does not have the ""Software Architect"" in it. Additionally, even if you want to keep coding, your code will always have to take the overall Software Architecture into account. Otherwise it will not be as effective.

https://www.udemy.com/course/discovering-backend-bottlenecks-unlocking-peak-performance/,Discovering Backend Bottlenecks: Unlocking Peak Performance,"Harness Chrome DevTools, MITM Proxy, and Wireshark to Pinpoint and Resolve Bottlenecks in Your Backend Stack","I used to think that performance of the backend depends on the application logic itself. However, there are many other factors that play a role in overall quality and performance of the application. Networking, connection establishment, security, backend communication, protocol serialization, intermediaries and much more. Often debugging the app if you have the source code allows the developer to zone in to the problem and identify it, However most of the time as an engineer you either don’t have access to the source code or its time consuming to debug a complex app. That is why in this course I present you with some tools I use to analyze the backend application performance and provide a good guess and what might be the problem without stepping in the code. Often known as black box testing. If your application is a web application that is consumable through a browser, devtools allow us to pretty much inspect all traffic going out from the app and can tell us so much about the app. If the app is not available in the browser we will then demonstrate MITM proxy which is a proxy that intercepts HTTP traffic and log it, this way we can inspect requests and see which of those are the culprit. Finally, if the app uses a protocol that isn’t HTTP intercepting it with a proxy becomes little tricky, so we will use both tcpdump and Wireshark to capture low level packets and see our requests this way. This course is designed for developers and engineers who have built backend and frontend applications and would like to take their skills further.

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that can generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. It is a language model that uses deep learning to generate text that is similar to human writing. You can use ChatGPT for various purposes such as automated customer service, virtual assistants, and more. What are the benefits or advantages of using ChatGPT? The advantages of using ChatGPT are that it can save time and money by automating tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. It can also provide quick and accurate responses to customer inquiries, which can improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, ChatGPT can be used to generate content such as articles, summaries, and more. How is ChatGPT different from Google? ChatGPT and Google serve different purposes and function in distinct ways, even though they both utilize artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Here are some key differences between the two: 1. Purpose: - ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI, designed to generate human-like text, answer questions, and engage in conversations. It is primarily focused on understanding and generating text-based content. - Google is a search engine that indexes and retrieves information from the internet. It helps users find websites, images, videos, and other content relevant to their search queries. 2. Functionality: - ChatGPT processes and generates text based on the input it receives, attempting to provide relevant and coherent responses. It can be used for tasks such as content creation, programming assistance, customer support, and more. - Google, on the other hand, uses complex algorithms to analyze and rank webpages based on their relevance to a user's search query. It does not generate content but rather directs users to existing sources of information. 3. User Interaction: - With ChatGPT, users engage in a more interactive, conversation-like experience. The AI model attempts to provide context-sensitive and coherent responses to user inputs. - Google provides a list of search results based on the user's query, and users must click on individual links to access the information they seek. 4. Data Source: - ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of text from various sources, and its knowledge is limited to the information available in its training data. - Google constantly crawls and indexes new information on the internet, making its search results more up-to-date and expansive compared to ChatGPT's knowledge base. In summary, ChatGPT is an AI language model designed for text generation and conversation, while Google is a search engine that helps users find information on the internet. They serve different purposes and offer unique functionalities, with ChatGPT focusing on content generation and Google on information retrieval.",Free,en_US

So I saw your course and after two or three lessons I already knew that I made a gold-value purchase. The teacher's explanation is crystal clear and to the point, while also considering alterative scenarios where a student might get stuck. Really good attention to detail and every minute of this course brings value to me and enriches my imagination with the power of Illustrator. This course is all you need to get from being an ok user of illustrator to being an expert with unlimited possibilities. Highly recommended."" This course will speed up your productivity & workflow. It is project based, so you will learn the tools & tricks to create some really beautiful current design styles. Even if you consider yourself an experienced user, I promise there will be things in here that will blow your Illustrator mind. You’ll learn advanced anchor point & pen tool tricks. There is a really fun section on mastering lines & strokes. You’ll learn the quick way to take hand drawn sketches and vectorize & color them. George:  ""I really enjoyed this course Dan, I finished it in 3 days because my intention was to go through it rather quickly. But the content of the course is amazing for someone who has been self-taught and has more or less followed their instinct thus far. You gave me a new perspective on tools that I was already using and opened my horizon by teaching some tools that I always looked at and thought ""what the heck"" is that for? - All around awesome!"" You’ll master depth & perspective in Illustrator, creating semi-flat presentations. We’ll set permanent defaults for fonts, colours & learn how to turn hyphenation off once and for all. You'll learn advanced logo design & graphic design techniques. We’ll make beautiful charts & graphs for your indesign documents. There is a colour mastery section where you will learn to make quick colour adjustments, gradients meshs & how to blend it all together.   Your creativity will be doubled once you finish the transform, distort & blending section of the course. Jamie:  This course was the perfect way for me to brush up on skills I haven't used in a while and also learn some really neat ways to save time. My company puts a big emphasis on working smart and doing things efficiently, and this course seriously helped me out in that department. I've always been pretty proficient in Illustrator, and have even gotten several comments about how fast I work, but this course is helping me take that to the next level. Thanks Dan! I truly enjoyed it! There is an entire section dedicated to learning how to speed up your personal workflow & how to speed up Illustrator and get it running super fast.  If you’re ok in Illustrator but you know there is so much more in there to be unlocked then please  join me and become an Illustrator super hero.",€94.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-1/,Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 1 - Functional),"Variables, Functions and Functional Programming, Closures, Decorators, Modules and Packages","Hello! This is  Part 1  of a series of courses intended to dive into the inner mechanics and more complicated aspects of  Python 3 . This is not a beginner course! If you've been coding Python for a week or a couple of months, you probably should keep writing Python for a bit more before tackling this series. On the other hand, if you've been studying or programming in Python for a bit, and are now starting to ask yourself questions such as: I wonder  how  this works? is there another,  more pythonic , way, of doing this? what's a closure? is that the same as a lambda? I know how to  use  a decorator someone else wrote, but how does it  work ? How do I write my own? why do some boolean expressions not return a boolean value? How can I use that to my advantage? how does the import mechanism in Python work, and why am I getting side effects? and similar types of question... then this course is for you. To get the most out of this course, you should be prepared to pause the coding videos, and attempt to write code before I do!  Sit back during the concept/theory videos, but lean in for the code videos! Please make sure you review the pre-requisites  for this course (below)  - although I give a brief refresh of basic concepts at the beginning of the course, those are concepts you should already be very comfortable with as you being this course. In this course series, I will give you a much more fundamental and  deeper understanding  of the Python language and the standard library. Python is called a ""batteries-included"" language for good reason - there is a ton of functionality in base Python that remains to be explored and studied. So this course is not about explaining my favorite 3rd party libraries - it's about Python, as a language, and the standard library. In particular this course is based on the canonical CPython. You will also need Jupyter Notebooks to view the downloadable fully-annotated Python notebooks.  It's about helping you explore Python and answer questions you are asking yourself as you develop more and more with the language. In  Python 3: Deep Dive (Part 1)  we will take a much closer look at: Variables - in particular that they are just symbols pointing to objects in memory (references) Namespaces and scopes Python's numeric types Python boolean type - there's more to a simple  or  statement than you might think! Run-time vs compile-time and how that affects function defaults, decorators, importing modules, etc Functions in general (including lambdas) Functional programming techniques (such as map, reduce, filter, zip, etc) Closures Decorators Imports, modules and packages Tuples as data structures Named tuples Course Prerequisites This is an intermediate to advanced Python course. To have the full benefit of this course you should be comfortable with the basic Python language including: variables and simple types such as str , bool , int  and float  types for  and while  loops if...else...  statements using simple lists , tuples , dictionaries  and sets defining functions (using the def  statement) writing simple classes using the class  keyword and the __init__  method, writing instance methods, creating basic properties using @property decorators importing modules from the standard library (e.g.  import math ) You should also: have Python 3.6 (or higher) installed on your system  be able to write and run Python programs using either: the command line, or  a favorite IDE (such as PyCharm),  have Jupyter Notebooks installed (which I use throughout this course so as to provide you fully annotated Python code samples)",€94.99,en_US

Option 1 is to do the course from start to finish. If you are new to geometry nodes or would like to learn every geometry node, this is the best option. Every video we will learn a new geometry node and each video will build on the last one The second option is to skip to any project or section and do just that section. Each section we start a brand new project so if you want to do a particular project or learn some particular nodes you can just skip to that section. The third option is if you want to learn or go over a particular node you can go to just that node and learn about that node or refresh your memory on that node! What will you have gained by the end of this course? By the end of this course you will have learned every single geometry node, their options and HOW to use them. Not only that but you will have created some awesome projects along the way.  The best part?  you will now be equipped with the knowledge and understanding to create your own geometry node based scenes!

All the procedures are explained live, on real life data sets. So you will advance fast and be able to apply your knowledge immediately. This course contains three sections. The first section is dedicated to the basic concepts related to neural networks and predictive analytics. You will find out what multilayer perceptrons are how they learn, what procedure they employ to make predictions. Also, you’ll learn the main prediction accuracy metrics for both numeric and categorical response variables. In the second section we’ll build and train a multilayer perceptron to predict a bank customers’ default. In other words, our response is categorical in this case. After training the network, we’ll use it to measure prediction accuracy in the test set. But that’s not all. We will also try to improve our model by manipulating various parameters of the network and test our model accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation technique. In the third section we build and train a model with a numeric response variable. More exactly, we’ll predict car prices depending on their technical features, using a multilayer perceptron, of course. After building the model we’ll measure its accuracy on the test set, try to improve it by modifying he network parameters and, finally, validate our model using the k-fold cross-validation method. So, the same steps as in the previous section, but this time for the particular case of a numeric dependent variable. A number of practical exercises are proposed at the end of the course. By doing these exercises you’ll actually apply in practice what you have learned. This course is your opportunity to become familiar with neural networks very fast.

https://www.udemy.com/course/quaternions/,A Crash Course in Understanding Quaternions,Learn how you can understand and implement quaternion rotations in your game projects,"Quaternions  are like vegetables. You know they are good for you but you aren't sure why and if only you knew how to make them taste good. Okay so you aren't going to be eating quaternions, but you get the idea.  They are this really advanced topic in geometry and mathematics that anyone who designs or programs games has heard about, might have even used, but have no real understanding about what they are achieving and why they are better than other methods. This short course will demystify the concept for you.  No, it won't give you the level of understanding of a postgraduate university mathematics major but it will provide you with the theory that will help you put quaternions and rotations in 3D space in context and give you the skills to use them with confidence in your game projects to overcome the limitations of other rotational methods. Learn how to program and work with: 4x4 Matrices to represent Euler angles. Quaternion operations included in the Unity API. Rotational controls for Slerp, RotateTowards, and LookAt. Contents and Overview In this short course, you will gain an understanding of the history of rotational mathematics and how quaternions came into existence.  It begins by examining Euler angles and how they are used to orient objects in 3D while then proceeding to explain how Euler angle multiplication breaks down into the issue known as 'gimbal lock'. Following this, a conceptual examination of basic rotational geometry is extrapolated from 2D space into the quaternion 4D.  It is then explained how 4 dimensions can be applied to 3D by implementing axis-angle rotations. The second half of the course provides some hands-on tutorials for applying quaternions to move and rotate 3D objects in the Unity Game Engine using C#. What students are saying about Penny's courses: Turns out, the hardest part of this course for me is finding the words to describe how glad I am to have enrolled in it. I honestly love Hollistic's teaching approach and I've never learned so much within a few hours about coding effectively with such detailed explanations! Penny is an excellent instructor and she does a great job of breaking down complex concepts into smaller, easy-to-understand topics.",Free,en_US

This one covers the latest version of Django by building a blog application. Python is one of the best programming languages in the planet. Why? For a few reasons: It's proven & scalable It's open-source The Internet of Things and Raspberry Pi It's leading the change for future technology Proven & Scalable : Python runs Instagram's backend. It also run's Pinterest's, NASA, Mozilla, and countless others. It scales. Open-Source:  Open source technology means **anyone** can change it. Literally anyone. Are you in New Zealand? Yup you can change the code. Are you in Argentina? Yup, go ahead change it. Open-source changes the game for everyone because we can all use it. Internet of Things (IoT) and Raspberry PI  Connected devices are coming in waves. The easiest way to connect to these devices is using the Raspberry Pi and writing code in Python. Python is versatile so it makes controlling real-world objects with Raspberry Pi simple.  Pushing the Bounds of Future Technology  Python is leading the charge in artificial intelligence with things like OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyBrain, and many others. Sooo... Python is cool but why is this called Try  Django ? What's  Django ? *** Django will be the backbone for your projects.  *** If you work with Python, the chances are good you need internet-connected data that  stored securely  and is  reliable . This is where Django comes in. Django is a web-framework that can handle all of your data and handle it better than any web framework out there. Django is the #1 Web Framework for Python for a reason: it's easy enough for the beginners and yet powerful enough for the pros. Instagram uses Python by way of Django. So does Pinterest. And Nasa. And Mozilla. It may not be the only technology that they use but its... the backbone of them all. If Python is the future behind underlying technology, Django will be it's close cousin and if you love Python, Django will soon become your friend. Cheers! Justin",Free,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-node-for-developers/,Node JS: Advanced Concepts,"Get advanced with Node.Js! Learn caching with Redis, speed up through clustering, and add image upload with S3 and Node!","Go beyond the basics of Node!  This course will give you the skills needed to become a top Node engineer.   Query Caching with Redis?  You will learn it.   The Node Event Loop ?  Included.   Scalable File Upload ?  Of course!   ------------------------------   This is a must-take course if you work with Node. Node Internals:  Here's one of the most common interview questions you'll face when looking for a Node job: "" Can you e xplain Node's Event Loop? ""  There are two types of engineers: those who can describe the Event Loop and those who cannot!  This course will ensure that you are incredibly well prepared to answer that most important question.  Besides being critical for interviews, knowledge of the Event Loop will give you a better understanding of  how Node works internally .  Many engineers know not to 'block' the Event Loop, but they don't necessarily understand why.  You will be one of the engineers who can clearly articulate the  performance profile  of Node and its Event Loop. Caching with Redis:  We'll also supercharge the performance of database queries by implementing  caching backed by Redis.   No previous experience of Redis is required!  Redis is an in-memory data store purpose built for solving caching needs.  By adding caching to your application, you can decrease the amount of time that any given request takes, improving the overall response time of your app. File Upload:  There are many resources online that offer suggestions on how to handle file upload, but few show a solution that can  truly scale .  Hint: saving files directly on your server isn't a scalable solution!  Learn how to leverage  AWS S3  to implement file upload that can scale to millions of users with a few dozen lines of simple code.  Plentiful discussions are included on security concerns with handling uploads, as well. Continuous Integration Testing:  This is a must have feature for any serious production app.  We'll first learn how to test huge swaths of our codebase with just a few lines of code by using  Puppeteer and Jest.   After writing many effective tests, we'll enable  continuous integration on Travis CI , a popular - and free - CI platform.  Testing can sometimes be boring, so we'll use this section to brush up on some advanced Javascript techniques, including one of the only legitimate uses of  ES2015 Proxies  that you'll ever see!   ------------------------------   Here's what we'll learn:   Master the  Node Event Loop  - understand how Node executes your source code.  Understand the purpose of Node, and how the code you write is eventually executed by    C++ code in the  V8 engine Add a huge boost to performance in your Node app through  clustering  and  worker threads Turbocharge MongoDB queries by adding  query caching  backed by a lightning-fast  Redis  instance Scale your app to infinity with  image and file upload  backed by Amazon's S3 file service Implement a  continuous integration testing pipeline  so you always know your project functions properly Think you know everything there is about managing   cookies and session ?  Well, you might, but learn even more! Ensure your app works the way you expect with automated browser testing using  Jest  and  Puppeteer Bonus - learn advanced JS techniques along the way, including where to use  ES2015 proxies !

https://www.udemy.com/course/mudras-for-self-healing/,Mudras for Beginners: Self Healing Techniques,Ultimate guide to using Simple Hand Gestures for Everlasting Health,"What is a Mudra? To put it simply, a Mudra is a hand gesture (using our fingers and thumb) that guides the energy flow to specific areas of the brain. There are many types of Mudras designed to bring different benefits, depending on what we specifically need. By practicing Mudras, a connection is developed with the patterns in the brain that influences the unconscious reflexes in the different areas. The internal energy is, in turn, balanced and redirected, creating an impact on mind and body. Our body is a mini world made of five elements, Fire, Air, Space, Earth and Water and when there is disturbance in these elements, it can lead to an imbalanced mind and cause our body to suffer from diseases. Mudras are a boon to mankind. The ancient science of Mudras is one of the greatest and finest gifts to the world. This science imparts knowledge that leads to self discovery, while providing a means to balance and maintain health independently and maximize the joy of living. The science of Mudras, a part of Yoga, is based on the fundamental principles of life, namely, the five elements as discussed above.  The Sages discovered that the whole creation is composed of the five elements mentioned above. They also deduced that the human structure is a miniature form of the universe and hence is also composed of the same five elements. Therefore they concluded that the secret of good health depends on the balance of the elements within the body and the imbalance in these five elements causes diseases of the body and mind. The Mudras are comprehensive in nature. They create inner peace and strength; eliminate fatigue and anxiety; promote physical and emotional health; help relieve stress, depression and anger. They calm the mind, sharpen the intellect, and promote love, happiness, prosperity and longevity. HAPPY LEARNING !!",Free,en_US

This short and sweet course will teach you to trade automatically on the Forex market, not just with the Forex trading robot but with  10 EAs for AUDUSD . More, you will learn how to create Expert Advisors for algo trading without programming skills. Hello! My name is Petko Aleksandrov, Head Mentor at Forex Academy, where we teach thousands of traders how to do algo trading with Expert Advisors on the Forex Market. This course will teach you how to avoid Demo testing when you do Forex algo trading. I will demonstrate to you the 2 methods I use, including the 10 AUDUSD Expert Advisors that I have created.  While there are plenty of Forex online courses that will teach you how to code Forex strategies, it is hard to find a practical course like this one that will provide you with ten ready Expert Advisors and will teach you how to create your own Forex trading robot without IT skills or trading experience. What will you learn in this Forex algo trading course? how to place the 10 Expert Advisors properly on the Meta Trader platform for trading generate strategies with a strategy builder over your Historical data export the Historical data and use your own broker's data for the Expert Advisors filter the generated strategies and select which Forex trading robot to use One method to test the robustness of the strategies without trying them on the Demo account A 2nd method that will teach you how to do it all automatically No previous experience  in algo trading or programming  is needed  - the system is suitable for complete beginners. This Forex algo trading course is ideal for traders who are looking for profitable strategies. Many people can not find even one strategy that is profitable with years. In this course, I will teach you how to create many and choose the top performers. The Expert Advisors (Robots) I review the 10 Expert Advisors regularly, and if any of those need a fix, I do it. The Expert Advisors are tested on my broker, but I strongly suggest you check them on the Demo account with your broker. This way, you can choose which Forex trading robot works best for you. In the algo trading course, I will show you the complete system with the two methods step by step, and you will decide which one works better for you. To generate the strategies, I have used the strategy builder EA Studio as a professional tool(if you want to test the program by yourself, I will show you how to use the free trial version to practice Forex algo trading). The Expert Advisors that are included in the course are ready for trading. I will provide you with the code itself, and all you will need to do is place the Forex trading robots on the Meta Trader. As a professional trader, I need to have a very detailed statistic for the strategies I use. I do not depend only on the backtest and the results. I want to know the Backtest output such as Profit Factor, Max stagnation, Count of Trader, Max Equity Drawdown, etc. This allows me to improve my strategies and look for better ones. I will show you all of that in the course. In most of my courses, I teach that we need to trade many Expert Advisors in one account. This way, we diversify the risk and achieve more stable results. We follow their performance, and we choose which Forex trading robots to place on a live account. This takes time. This is why, in this course, I have put the best of my experience to show you the two methods that you can use to avoid the Demo testing and trade straight to the live account. Who is the instructor in this algo trading course? My name is Petko Aleksandrov, and I am a professional trader with over 10 years of experience. I have dedicated myself to recording online trading courses showing my Forex algo trading during the last few years. I enjoy sharing my strategies and Expert Advisors with other traders because I meet people worldwide. The online learning environment allows us to improve quickly and be aware of the most modern and profitable methods. I prefer to use Forex Algo trading compared to Manual trading because it is possible to eliminate the emotions in trading, which causes 99% of the traders to lose. This course will show you how to place the 10 Expert Advisors, so you can start to trade with them. If you have any questions, I am always there to answer.

We will using the right architecture design patterns and techniques. By the end of the course, you will Learn how to  handle millions of request  with designing system for  high availability, high scalability ,  low latency , and  resilience  to network failures on microservices distributed architectures. This course is will be the  journey of software architecture design  with step by step evolving architecture from monolithic to event driven microservices. We will  start  the  basics  of  software architecture  with designing e-commerce  Monolithic architecture  that handles low amount of requests. After that step by step  evolves  the architecture with; Layered Architecture Clean Architecture Modular Monolithic Architecture Microservices Event-Driven Microservices Architectures and lastly  Serverless Microservices Architectures  with designing together that handle millions of requests. This is a step-by-step process for software system design and evolve from monolithic to microservices following the patterns & principles. We will discuss microservices architectures with all aspects,  Microservices  Decomposition Microservices  Communications  (Sync / Async Message-Based Communication, API Gateways) Microservices  Data Management  (Databases / Query / Commands) Microservices  Transaction Management Microservices  Distributed Caching Microservices  Deployments with Containers and Orchestrators Microservices  Resilience with applying microservices design patterns and practices. We are going to design with together and  step by step with refactor architectures  with all aspects of microservices pillars. We will start with designing  Monolithic Architecture . And you can see that we have  Functional  and  Non-functional requirements  that should cover our design and we have  patterns and principles toolbox  that we will learn and use these principles when evolving architectures. Way of Learning — The Course Flow We will  always starts with the problem  and try to solve this problem with learning and designing new architectures, patterns and best practices. Problem -> Learn -> Design -> Adapt -> Evaluate We will  complete this circle for every section  of the course. You will find that we will add new requirements in order to handle millions of request and learn new patterns and practices that will use these principles when evolving architectures. You will find that we will add new requirements in order to  handle millions of request  and  learn new patterns  and  practices  that will use these principles when  evolving architectures . We will see full of patterns and principle toolbox is loading with new patterns and apply them into current designs. We will see  latest patterns that we use more than 30 patterns  and practices with implementing  high scalability, high availability  and handle millions of request requirements. Let me write some microservices pattern which we covered in this course; The  Database-per-Service  Pattern API Gateway  Pattern,  Gateway Routing/Aggregation/Offloading  Pattern Backends for Frontends  pattern BFF Service Aggregator  Pattern,  Service Registry/Discovery  Pattern Fan-out Publish/Subscribe Messaging  Pattern Topic-Queue Chaining & Load Balancing  Pattern The  Shared Database Anti-Pattern  and  Polyglot Persistence Database Sharding  Pattern,  CAP   Theorem Materialized View  Pattern CQRS  and  Event Sourcing  Patterns SAGA Pattern  —  Choreography-based/Orchestration-based  SAGA Compensating Transaction  Pattern Transactional Outbox  Pattern Dual Write  Problem CDC — Change Data Capture  with  Outbox Pattern Event Hubs  and  Real-time Event Streaming  in Event-Driven Microservices Architecture Cache-Aside Pattern  for  Microservices Distributed Caching Sidecar  Pattern Service Mesh  Pattern DevOps  and  CI/CD Pipelines  for Microservices Deployments Deployment Strategies  for Microservices: Blue-green, Rolling and Canary deployments Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  and usage in Microservices Deployments Microservices Resilience ,  Observability  and  Monitoring  Patterns Retry and Circuit Breaker  Patterns Bulkhead  /  Timeout  /  Cache  /  Fallback  Patterns Elastic Stack  for Microservices Observability with  Distributed Logging Microservices Health Checks: Liveness ,  Readiness  and  Performance  Checks Serverless Microservices Architecture  implementation on AWS So the course flow will be the both  theoretical  and  practical  information; We will  always start with a business problem We will learn a specific pattern,  why  and  where  we should  use After that we will see the  Reference architectures  that applied these patterns After that we will design our architecture with applying this newly learned pattern with together And lastly we will decide which  Technologies  can be choices for that architectures.	 And at the last section, we will made  Code Review for Existing Microservices Architecture Repository  on GitHub for practical implementation of microservices architecture. So this course will includes  Hands-on Design Activities Iterate  Design Architecture from On-Premises to Cloud Server-less architectures Evolves  architecture monolithic to  Event-Driven Microservices Architectures Refactoring  System Design for handling million of requests Apply best practices with microservices design patterns and principles Examine microservices patterns with all aspects like  Communications ,  Data Management, Caching  and  Deployments Prepare for  Software Architecture Interviews Prepare for  System Design Architecture Interview exams .	 I have been joined several famous company's architecture position interviews, also involved software architect positions assessment process more than  50+ interviews   collect the architecture requirements  for software industry positions. So with this course, you will gain  real-world experience  about all architecture positions from monolithic to event-driven microservices architectures. This course prepared for the beginner but at least you should familiar with basics of software architectures. This course will have good theoretical information but also will be  90% of hands-on design activities . All course architecture steps will designed step by step and together.

https://www.udemy.com/course/subscription-business-models-for-management-consultants/,Subscription Business Models for Management Consultants,A practical guide how to analyze & model subscription businesses in Excel,"What is the aim of this course? More and more firms switch from transaction-based businesses to subscription businesses. This business model requires a different approach when it comes to analyzing it in Excel. During some consulting projects, you may be asked to analyze or model subscription business models in Excel and advise firms on the best course of action. In this course, I will teach how to model fast and efficiently subscription businesses in Excel and how to analyze them during consulting projects. In the course you will learn the following things: How to  model  different  subscription  businesses in  Excel How to  analyze  whether the  switch to a subscription  model makes sense or not How to  analyze customer acquisition This course is based on my 15 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting firms and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, performance improvement, and turn-arounds in the biggest firms from Retail, FMCG, SMG, B2B, and services sectors that I worked for. I have carried out or supervised over 90 different performance improvement projects in different industries that generated a total of 2 billion in additional EBITDA. On the basis of what you will find in this course, I have trained in person over 100 consultants, business analysts, and managers who now are Partners in PE and VC funds, Investment Directors and Business Analysts in PE and VC, Operational Directors, COO, CRO, CEO, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members, etc. On top of that my courses on  Udemy  were already taken by more than  185 000 students  including people working in EY, Walmart, Booz Allen Hamilton, Adidas, Naspers, Alvarez & Marsal, McKinsey, PwC, Dell, Walgreens, Orange, and many others. I teach through case studies, so you will have a lot of lectures showing examples of analyses, and tools that we use. To every lecture, you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excels as well as additional presentations, and materials shown in the lectures so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modifications, be applied by you or your team in your work. Why have I decided to create this course? Subscription businesses are not the dominant form in most industries. Many people struggle with capturing the complexity of such businesses in Excel. Subscription businesses also require a totally different approach to customer acquisition and retention. Most universities are not addressing this sort of business. Also, some consulting firms don’t provide their consultants with enough opportunities to understand and learn how subscription business work. Therefore, I have decided to create this course that will help students  understand or refresh their knowledge  of subscription businesses .  The course will give you the knowledge and insight into real-life case studies that will make your life during a consulting project much easier. Thanks to this course, you will know what and how to do during consulting projects devoted to subscription businesses. You will master the modeling of subscription businesses in Excel and analyze whether the switch to such a model will make sense. On top of that, you will learn how to approach customer acquisition and retention. To sum it up, I believe that if you want to become a world-class Management Consultant or Business Analyst you have to have a pretty decent understanding of subscription businesses. That is why, I highly recommend this course to Management Consultants or Business Analysts, especially those that did not finish business school or Economics. The course will help you become an expert in subscription businesses on the level of McKinsey, BCG, Bain, and other top consulting firms. In what way will you benefit from this course? The course is a practical, step-by-step guide loaded with tons of analyses, tricks, and hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you understand, and analyze businesses. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. Our intention is that thanks to the course you will learn: 1. How to  model  different  subscription  businesses in  Excel 2. How to  analyze  whether the  switch to a subscription  model makes sense or not 3. How to  analyze customer acquisition You can also ask me any question either through the discussion field or by messaging me directly. How the course is organized? The course is divided currently into the following sections: Introduction.  We begin with a little intro to the course as well as some general info on how the course is organized. Essential Concepts.  We will start by explaining some essential concepts that later we will use to describe and show you the differences between subscription businesses. I will explain what we mean by subscription businesses, churn rate, MRR, and MRR churn. I will also provide examples of firms using a subscription model. Modeling Subscription Businesses in Excel.  Modeling Subscription Businesses in Excel requires a bit different approach than transaction-based businesses. We will show you in this section how to do it. I will start with transaction-based e-commerce, after which we will show you how to model e-commerce as a subscription. Later on, we will also model the streaming businesses. SaaS.  A lot of SaaS businesses run as subscription businesses. We will discuss what SaaS is, what KPIs you should pay attention to, and how to model them in Excel. Customer Acquisition.  Without customer acquisition, you will not enjoy much growth. In e-commerce, you will spend a lot of time optimizing and finding more optimal ways to acquire customers. In this section, we will discuss how to calculate customer acquisition costs, how to lower them, and how to increase the value of the customer. You will be able also to download many additional resources 1. Useful frameworks and techniques 2. Models & Analyses shown in the course 3. Additional resources 4.

https://www.udemy.com/course/virtual-assistant-training-the-most-requested-services/,Must-Have Skills (Training) for Virtual Assistants in 2023,Get training for the most frequently requested services (+ free delegation eBook and TONS of templates and scripts).,"Clients are eager to hire virtual assistants who bring a wide variety of  strong  skills to the table. While clients (should) provide you some sense of how they like their tasks to be completed,  they don't usually have the time or resources to train you on basic tasks.   That's where this course comes in. This course will  train you on must-have skills  and  provide downloadable templates and scripts  for you to use with your own clients.  This course has  three main goals: To give you  training on the most common tasks/requests .  To give you  basic training and tips on the common back-of-office  things you'll need to do as a VA (think how to send clients an invoice, how to store client data securely, and even how fast you should aim to respond to client emails).  To help you  ""standardize"" your work , enabling you to work smarter and not harder. SKILLS YOU WILL LEARN Calendar Management:  Learn to access client's calendars, schedule appointments/meetings, best online tools, and more. Inbox Management:  Learn to request access to client's inboxes, send emails on client's behalf, create filters and priority systems. Expense Reporting:  Learn the basics of expense reporting and about some of the most common corporate expense systems. Social Media Maintenance:  Learn how to automate social media posts, including a mix of free and paid tools, and track metrics. Research:  Learn how to provide easy-to-digest  comparative, data, and informational  research to your clients. Lead generation:  Learn how to find  any email  and create lists of leads (or potential clients) for your own client's business.  Event planning:  Learn how to research and book vendors and manage guest lists and budgets. Travel booking:  Learn to research the best flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, book with peace of mind, and check clients into travel ahead of time.  Photo/Presentation Editing:  Learn the basics of editing photos and presentations, including the best free online tools that go way beyond Canva. Making purchases:  Learn the proper way to make a purchase on a client's behalf. But wait!  What if your client requests something that you're totally  unfamiliar with ? The double-edged sword of working as a freelance VA is that you are responsible for your own continuing education. You'll learn about strategies to help you manage tasks that are WAY above your head (without losing your clients). We'll also cover  basics  about  back-off-office training,  like how to invoice clients, keep their data stored safely, and why you might consider  end-of-week reports  or weekly check-ins. THIS COURSE INCLUDES Templates, templates, templates!  Standardize your work and save yourself precious time by  downloading  or  bookmarking  my pre-made templates. Skip the ""building"" and start using these documents with your own clients, including but not limited to: travel research social media purchasing event planning  Checklists  to ensure you're not skipping any step for any task. Pre-made spreadsheets  to help you track projects, like social media management. Scripts  to use with your own clients. A free delegation eBook  to give to your clients. Delegation is a skill and not all clients are innately great at delegating tasks. If you have a client who struggles to give you tasks, slip them this eBook to help get their creative juices flowing.  Who this course is for:  New to beginner virtual assistants looking for some extra training on commonly requested tasks.  Who this course is not for:  This course  will not teach you how to find clients.  Start with the course ""How to Find Your FIRST Virtual Assistant Clients"" instead. Additionally, if you're a well established VA who already has a good handle on common tasks, you might not find more value from this content. THIS COURSE IS BEST VIEWED ON THE WEB (AND NOT ON A MOBILE PHONE). More about the teacher: I'm Erin, I've been a Virtual Assistant since 2012.

https://www.udemy.com/course/virtual-assistant-training-the-most-requested-services/,Must-Have Skills (Training) for Virtual Assistants in 2023,Get training for the most frequently requested services (+ free delegation eBook and TONS of templates and scripts).,"Clients are eager to hire virtual assistants who bring a wide variety of  strong  skills to the table. While clients (should) provide you some sense of how they like their tasks to be completed,  they don't usually have the time or resources to train you on basic tasks.   That's where this course comes in. This course will  train you on must-have skills  and  provide downloadable templates and scripts  for you to use with your own clients.  This course has  three main goals: To give you  training on the most common tasks/requests .  To give you  basic training and tips on the common back-of-office  things you'll need to do as a VA (think how to send clients an invoice, how to store client data securely, and even how fast you should aim to respond to client emails).  To help you  ""standardize"" your work , enabling you to work smarter and not harder. SKILLS YOU WILL LEARN Calendar Management:  Learn to access client's calendars, schedule appointments/meetings, best online tools, and more. Inbox Management:  Learn to request access to client's inboxes, send emails on client's behalf, create filters and priority systems. Expense Reporting:  Learn the basics of expense reporting and about some of the most common corporate expense systems. Social Media Maintenance:  Learn how to automate social media posts, including a mix of free and paid tools, and track metrics. Research:  Learn how to provide easy-to-digest  comparative, data, and informational  research to your clients. Lead generation:  Learn how to find  any email  and create lists of leads (or potential clients) for your own client's business.  Event planning:  Learn how to research and book vendors and manage guest lists and budgets. Travel booking:  Learn to research the best flights, hotels, vacation rentals, car rentals, book with peace of mind, and check clients into travel ahead of time.  Photo/Presentation Editing:  Learn the basics of editing photos and presentations, including the best free online tools that go way beyond Canva. Making purchases:  Learn the proper way to make a purchase on a client's behalf. But wait!  What if your client requests something that you're totally  unfamiliar with ? The double-edged sword of working as a freelance VA is that you are responsible for your own continuing education. You'll learn about strategies to help you manage tasks that are WAY above your head (without losing your clients). We'll also cover  basics  about  back-off-office training,  like how to invoice clients, keep their data stored safely, and why you might consider  end-of-week reports  or weekly check-ins. THIS COURSE INCLUDES Templates, templates, templates!  Standardize your work and save yourself precious time by  downloading  or  bookmarking  my pre-made templates. Skip the ""building"" and start using these documents with your own clients, including but not limited to: travel research social media purchasing event planning  Checklists  to ensure you're not skipping any step for any task. Pre-made spreadsheets  to help you track projects, like social media management. Scripts  to use with your own clients. A free delegation eBook  to give to your clients. Delegation is a skill and not all clients are innately great at delegating tasks. If you have a client who struggles to give you tasks, slip them this eBook to help get their creative juices flowing.  Who this course is for:  New to beginner virtual assistants looking for some extra training on commonly requested tasks.  Who this course is not for:  This course  will not teach you how to find clients.  Start with the course ""How to Find Your FIRST Virtual Assistant Clients"" instead. Additionally, if you're a well established VA who already has a good handle on common tasks, you might not find more value from this content. THIS COURSE IS BEST VIEWED ON THE WEB (AND NOT ON A MOBILE PHONE). More about the teacher: I'm Erin, I've been a Virtual Assistant since 2012.

Do you want to empower your clients to  break free  of limitations and remember their  forgotten dreams ? Do you want to help your clients reach their  potential  and fulfill their greater purpose? There is nothing more honorable and fulfilling than being a guide (a transformation life coach) for a person who is embarking on  a quest of inner transformation —a hero’s journey.   Transformation happens... Sometimes it sneaks up on us after years of  quiet suffering . Other times it is the inevitable side effect of a life struck by a sudden  tsunami of unwanted change  and pain. Sometimes we dive head first into the journey  we feel called  to, but other times we cling desperately to “what was”, like a terrified butterfly unwilling to let go of the empty casing that once housed the caterpillar. Life is exhausting, painful, and dark when trapped in the cell of our resistance to change. And this is why  so many people need a transformation life coach  to guide them through the process of following through on dreams and creating change that lasts. As a transformation life coach, you can help your clients choose to  stop submitting  to a life of mediocrity and unfulfillment, and instead discover that  their life has a greater purpose .  As a transformation life coach, you can help them embrace that they are  the hero of their own journey . That they no longer have to see their pain or challenges as obstacles that are holding them back, but instead see them as stepping stones to a greater purpose. As a transformation life coach, you can empower them to stop allowing others to write the chapters of your life story and decide, once and for all, to  live life on their terms. Transformation is an inside job , and change is a process. This course will provide you  proven, practical processes  to use with your life coaching clients to successful create life change, but even more importantly it will provide a  7-step process for totally transforming a client’s life,  from the inside out. In this course, you will learn how to help your life coaching clients create life transformation by: ·        Identify the  blocks  that hold them back so they can become  unstoppable  ·        Overcome  fear  of change, rejection and failure so they can feel confident  going for their dream ·        Develop  self-mastery  by reprogramming limiting beliefs  ·        Develop a  growth mindset  so they know without a doubt that nothing can stand in their way again ·        Get absolutely clear about what they REALLY want and who they REALLY are so they can stop living everyone else’s dreams Invite your life coaching clients to join you on a quest of transformation  that will lead them on a hero’s journey to a place where they really can do what they dream of and become all that they are meant to be.

The only course you need to become a Salesforce Developer.,"A course designed for all who aspire to become a Salesforce Developer. If you are new to the programming world and doesn't speak technology,  take this course . If you are someone experienced and looking to skill up,  take this course . If you are a student or a recent graduate or a Salesforce admin or an IT professional,  take this course . This is: ""ONE COURSE TO RULE THEM ALL""   The course is designed for all experience levels. You will start from ground 0 and in no time, you will summit the very peak of Salesforce Development.  You will learn all the nasty backend stuff ( Apex Development ) and all the cool frontend stuff ( Lightning Development ).  While climbing the Salesforce Development peak, you will face many challenges  (60+ Challenges)  and  real-time projects  to help you build that muscle memory and make you a proficient Salesforce Developer.   The course will make you better than 90% of experienced Salesforce Developers out there.  Why do I say so? Because I trust my teaching skills and the words of my students. This is how your journey will look like in this course: Crawl -  I will teach Web Application Fundamentals. How does the web work? What is an application? What is the frontend and what is a backend? This will be your foundation for what's coming next. Walk-  Here you will learn the fundamentals of Salesforce Apex Development. Everything a developer should know. We will start with something very basic like variables and data types, and we will gradually make our way upwards. Of course, at each step of this journey, you will challenges (a lot of them) which will help you build your problem-solving abilities. Run -  This is where you will start picking up and start meeting the standards of experienced Salesforce developers.

Fly -  Time to get ahead of the crowd. And how will you do that? With help of the boss-level challenge, I have put in the course. Being a Salesforce Developer myself (and having worked in companies like Salesforce, Google, Amazon) I myself struggled and scratched my head to write the solution of these boss-level challenges. I can guarantee that at least 90% of Salesforce Developers out there will not be able to write the solution to these challenges in one go. Did I scare you? Nothing to worry about, every single concept and every single problem is explained with step by step solutions I have put in place.

Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.   Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.    -------- Adam  is one of the instructors at Zero To Mastery, one of the highest rated and fastest growing software development academies on Udemy.

POWERPOINT BASICS  - Learn to use the software properly and get a brief grasp over its most important components and tools. I will show you the essentials, so we can work swiftly in PowerPoint going forward.     2. ANIMATION BASICS  – Learn how to properly use animation.

This course will teach you all the necessary basics and advanced tools, but it's not a PowerPoint 101 for beginners. I mention basic tools and techniques, but I assume that you are computer savvy and know how to find your way around PowerPoint already.   I'm enrolled in your Master PowerPoint presentations course. Should I get this one or is the other one enough?   Which one is better? Good Question! Both courses are top PowerPoint courses that teach you the knowledge and tools to create outstanding presentations, animations, and templates. They are just two different versions that use different slides and unique content respectively. The benefit of that is you can follow a different design path on each course. Students who finished the first master course were asking me for more, and I'm happy to provide more if there is demand for it. If you already feel super-comfortable with PowerPoint, one course is enough. But if you seek even more design ideas and slides, and if you like my content and the way I teach, you won't go wrong by taking both courses.    With both courses, you can reach a similar level of PPT knowledge, but in different ways and different designs. Each of those two courses has several unique sections that allow them to expand your knowledge on their own way. I've been using PowerPoint for 15+ years and think I know the most already, will I learn anything?   I'm an experienced PowerPoint instructor with over 250 YouTube tutorials and more than 10 published PowerPoint courses and series. Over the past few years, I have learned from both beginner and advanced students which areas to address to best influence your workflow in a positive and impactful way. My courses help you to boost your efficiency, using shortcuts and on-trend designs to help you to reach a modern, top-level standard of quality. If you need something that is not already in the course, you can always ask me about topics to add to courses that interest you.   I'm still not sure if I want to invest into this course. I don't know if I want to focus on design or on animation? Is there any fall-back plan? Of course! First, you should watch the promo videos and watch the free preview lessons. They will give you a good understanding of the course content, pace, and what to expect from taking the course.

Finally, before each style section, you will have an opportunity to take a style quiz to help you find out which interior design styles are best suited to you based on your preferences.  Once you find out your results, this may help you to determine which lectures you would like to watch or how to prioritize watching them. For bonus material, I have included a lecture with my favorite plant species for each of the 18 different styles. This course is a  great choice  for: Anyone wanting to learn more about different interior design styles How to mix them successfully on their own Interior design students who are new to their field Interior designer professionals who want to brush up their skills Join me for a exciting journey into the world of interior design styles! IMPORTANT NOTES: If you are interested in taking most or all of my courses,  I have a recommended order in which to watch them  (although it's certainly not required).  I would start with ""How to Design a Room in 10 Easy Steps"" because most of my other courses are in-depth classes of the concepts touched on in this 10 step class.  Following the 10 Step Course, I suggest moving on to ""How to Use Color Like a Pro"", followed by ""How to Work with Interior Design Styles Like a Pro"", then ""How to Use Lighting Design to Transform your Home"", and finally ""Design is in the Details"".   My other five courses , ""How to Use Minimalist Interior Design to Live your Best Life"",  ""Use Eco-friendly, Sustainable Design to Improve Your Life"", ""How to Design Your Dream Kitchen"", ""How to Design Your Dream Bathroom"", and ""Everything Small Home Design"" are all stand alone classes on specialty topics within interior design, and therefore, can be taken in any order. Please be aware that this course, or any of my courses, is not intended to provide all of the knowledge needed to become a professional interior designer.   As with any professional field, there is a significant amount of education and/or experience that is needed to achieve competency in this field.  My intention with these courses is to provide some solid foundational knowledge to assist either those individuals interested in ""DIY"" interior design to work on their own projects more effectively, or to provide supplemental education to both interior design students and professionals.",€159.99,en_US

Ayahuasca contains a neuron inhibitor and when this neuronal network is inhibited, a high concentration of DMT is generated, so the practitioner feels and perceives experiences that are transcendental to everyday human life. But the heart system is an even more transcendental strategic point than simply inhibiting neurons because it does stimulate the evolution of the energy system, especially the heart chakra, which is the point of connection between the most human experiences and the transcendental experiences. Having this point developed and activated, the ordinary functioning of the brain is also inhibited. An activity similar to what happens with the Ayahuasca inhibitor and a strong sense of well-being happens in humans, a DMT-like experienced in Ayahuasca. Since the development of the heart system and the experience with the active heart system is much longer-lasting and allows the practitioner to evolve from a more conscious state. What is holistic therapy for? Reconnect with your essence and spirituality; Have balance for holistic health, considering: body, mind, emotions and soul; To make room for feelings and emotions; Have healthy thoughts, attitudes and relationships; Free yourself from blocks and fears; Feeling good and happy with yourself; Discover your virtues and what moves you, creating a new reality in your life! But how does Holistic Therapy work? Holistic Therapies are a set of varied techniques, but some essential elements make up the work of all of them, to lead us to well-being and health! One of these elements is self-knowledge, that is, knowledge of ourselves. Many of us are used to focusing only on what happens outside of us (others' opinions, news, happenings in society, at work, etc.). Self-knowledge is an invitation to understand what is going on inside us. It is through self-knowledge exercises that we can: know our virtues, fears and traumas; welcome our emotions and thoughts; understand the signals the body transmits; knowing what brings well-being to our lives. Another important element of Holistic Therapy is the concept of having a holistic view of health, comprising our physical, mental, emotional, social, environmental, energetic and spiritual aspects. Holistic therapy also works with spirituality. It has nothing to do with “spiritism” or “religion”. From the most religious person, even the most atheist can practice spirituality! Spirituality is described as: “the human propensity to seek meaning in life through concepts that transcend the tangible, looking for a sense of connection with something greater than itself”. In other words, it is what brings meaning to life, and it is individual to each one. Along with spirituality, some Holistic Therapies also address purpose. We all have purposes in our life, family, work, etc. Therapy helps you recognize your life purpose, what your roles are, and how to live them out. Holistic Therapy is indicated in cases of: Body-mind-soul balance; Search for your life purpose and spirituality; To have more mental and emotional health: in cases of anxiety, stress and other ailments; When you feel you need help and rebalancing; When you want to change your life; To take care of your health in a natural way; In the search for emotional intelligence and self-knowledge. You can also learn holistic therapy to: Help to unlock prosperity in your life; Dealing with conflict in relationships; To deal with trauma and anything else that is keeping your life from flowing as you wish! All these benefits? Yes, everything in our life is interconnected! With the help of Holistic Therapy, you will have more self-knowledge to understand the causes of this dissatisfaction and how it is possible to modify this pattern through the techniques. And also, prevent it with awareness. Also, another benefit of holistic techniques is that they are completely natural and non-invasive, so they don't generate any side effects.",Free,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/business-analysis-defined/,What Is Business Analysis for Information Technology (IT),An Overview of Business Analysis Activities and Current Business Analysis Techniques,"Business Analysis in the Real World A Buddhist proverb warns, “Be mindful of intention. Intention is the seed that creates our future.” In a very real sense, this statement expresses the reason for business analysis. This discipline is really all about choosing and defining a desired future because without intention (expressed in business analysis terms, “requirements”), no future is more or less desirable than another.   In reality, every organization does some form of business analysis whether it uses the term or not. For many (especially larger organizations), it is an extremely structured, managed process while others thrive on change and only do business analysis when and as needed. The perception that business analysis is only needed to develop IT solutions is inaccurate. Actually, it is a critical component of any change initiative within an organization whether software is involved or not.   Current Business Analysis Techniques and Methods The course defines how business analysis is currently practiced. The authors provide insight into this fast-growing field by distinguishing  strategic, tactical,  and  operational  business analysis. It provides surveys of what Business Analysts really do and what business analysis techniques people use most often when they are the one “wearing the BA hat”. You will learn what “requirements” really are and what different types of requirements exist. Because many requirements define future information technology (IT) solutions, the authors share their experience on how Waterfall, Iterative, Agile, and Experimental (aka ""Chaotic"") Software Development methodologies impact the business analysis responsibility.   Who Needs Business Analysis Skills? Although the field of Business Analysis offers great career opportunities for those seeking employment, some level of business analysis skill is essential for any adult in the business world today. Many of the techniques used in the field evolved from earlier lessons learned in systems analysis and have proven themselves to be useful in every walk of life. We have personally experienced how business analysis techniques help even in your private life.   We created this course for everyday people in the real world to give you a basic understanding of some core business analysis methods and concepts. If this course answers some of your questions, great. If it raises more questions than it answers (implying that it piqued your curiosity), even better. If it motivates you to learn more about this emerging and fascinating topic, it has served its purpose well.",Free,en_US

It is developed and maintained by Facebook, and is often used for building single-page applications and mobile applications. One reason to learn React is that it is a popular and in-demand technology, so learning it can improve your job prospects and make it easier to find work as a front-end developer. React is also a good choice for building modern web applications because it is efficient, scalable, and fast, and it uses a virtual DOM (a lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM) to minimize the number of DOM manipulations required, which makes it easier to build high-performance applications. Another reason to learn React is that it is a well-designed and flexible library that makes it easy to build reusable components that can be composed to build complex user interfaces. This makes it easier to maintain and update your codebase over time, as you can reuse components in multiple places rather than having to rewrite the same code multiple times.

https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-networking-for-effective-backend-design/,Fundamentals of Network Engineering,Understanding the first principles of networking to build low latency and high throughput backends,"We are entering an era in software engineering where we rely on libraries and frameworks to do most of our work. While this is useful and save tremendous dev hours, it creates leaky abstractions that manifest in form of performance degradation, unexpected errors, 100% CPU , network and disk usage, hangs, latency and many other. It becomes difficult to articulate what goes wrong on the backend and how to fix it when engineers don't understand the basic building block of what they are interacting with.  Network communication is one of the most critical pieces in backend engineering. And the TCP/IP Internet suite is the basic fundemntal building block of communications that link the frontend to the backend. Any protocol we use eventually gets encapsulated into either a TCP segment or UDP datagram. That packet is wrapped in an IP packet which is placed into a frame and then sent across the network. These layers are important to understand for backend engineers in order to optimize the stack, minimize latency, and increase throughput. What matters  is the true understanding of these pieces and not just memorizing definitions and packet headers to pass an exam. If an engineer truly understood what is happening when their backend API receives an HTTP POST request for example, they will be astonished at how much is happening behind the scenes. They would completely change the way they approach backend API designs, they will try to select the best protocol for the job, and they will tune that protocol to its maximum potential. They will start asking questions about frameworks and libraries that nobody else does. It is those questions that will make them fully utilize those framework to their maximum potential.  This course is primarily designed for backend engineers who built applications, services or APIs and want to take their skillset to the next level. If you are a frontend engineer who are interested in the backend and have attempted to build backend apps before this course is also for you. If you are a network engineer who already know the basic fundamentals and want to start building backend applications effectively this course might help you bridge the gap This course is not designed for those who want to pass network certification tests (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE etc..)",€94.99,en_US

Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization’s infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them. The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so, they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them. Ethical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the old saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.” They check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to: Injection attacks Changes in security settings Exposure of sensitive data Breach in authentication protocols Components used in the system or network that may be used as access points",Free,en_US
https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-csharp-dotnet/,Design Patterns in C# and .NET,Discover the modern implementation of design patterns with C# and .NET,"Course Overview   This course provides a comprehensive overview of  Design Patterns in C# and .NET  from a practical perspective. This course in particular covers patterns with the use of:   The latest versions of C# and the .NET framework Use of modern programming approaches: dependency injection, reactive programming and more Use of modern developer tools such as ReSharper Discussions of pattern variations and alternative approaches   This course provides an overview of all the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns as outlined in their seminal book, together with modern-day variations, adjustments, discussions of intrinsic use of patterns in the language.   What are Design Patterns?   Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They were popularized with the 1994 book  Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software  by  Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson and Richard Helm  (who are commonly known as a Gang of Four, hence the GoF acronym).   The original book was written using C++ and Smalltalk as examples, but since then, design patterns have been adapted to every programming language imaginable: C#, Java, PHP and even programming languages that aren't strictly object-oriented, such as JavaScript.   The appeal of design patterns is immortal: we see them in libraries, some of them are intrinsic in programming languages, and you probably use them on a daily basis even if you don't realize they are there.   What Patterns Does This Course Cover?   This course covers  all  the GoF design patterns. In fact, here's the full list of what is covered:   SOLID Design Principles : Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle and Dependency Inversion Principle Creational Design Patterns : Builder, Factories (Factory Method and Abstract Factory), Prototype and Singleton Structrural Design Patterns : Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Façade, Flyweight and Proxy Behavioral Design Patterns : Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Null Object, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method and Visitor   Who Is the Course For?   This course is for .NET/C# developers who want to see not just textbook examples of design patterns, but also the different variations and tricks that can be applied to implement design patterns in a modern way. For example, the introduction of the DLR allows us to use an ImpromptuObject, so that our DynamicObject exposes any interface we desire. This allows for dynamic programming, and many design patterns are presented in terms of their static and DLR-based variations.   Presentation Style   This course is presented as a (very large) series of live demonstrations being done in Microsoft Visual Studio. Most demos are single-file, so you can download the file attached to the lesson and run it in Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Rider or another IDE of your choice.   This course does not use UML class diagrams; all of demos are live coding. I use Visual Studio, various NuGet packages, R# unit test runner and even dotMemoryUnit.",€109.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-functions-using-python/,Getting Started with AWS Lambda Functions using Python,Learn how to get started with AWS Lambda Functions using Python run time for free,"As part of this free course, you will learn how to get started with AWS lambda functions using Python run time. Here is the high-level outline for the course. AWS Lambda is one of the most popular fully managed AWS Services supporting different run times. As the IT Industry has adapted microservices architecture, serverless functions become a vital component in building large-scale complex applications.  Overview of AWS Lambda and Getting Started using Python 3 Passing Arguments to AWS Lambda and Processing using Python Using Customer Handlers for AWS Lambda Functions using Python 3 Using AWS Services such as s3 in AWS Lambda Functions Recap of handling permissions using AWS IAM Roles and User Groups Develop AWS Lambda Function to list objects from AWS S3 Bucket Passing Environment Variables to AWS Lambda Functions Customizing Resources such as memory used for AWS Lambda Function Setup Local Development Environment for AWS Lambda Functions Develop logic for AWS Lambda Function using external packages Build Zip file to deploy as AWS Lambda Function Deploy Application with External Dependencies as AWS Lambda Function Here is the detailed outline for the course. First, you will start with prerequisites such as having a valid AWS account as AWS Lambda Functions are supposed to be deployed as part of the AWS Account. Once you have a valid AWS account, you will understand what AWS Lambda is and how to deploy the first application using Python 3 run-time using AWS Web Console. We should be able to pass arguments to any applications including AWS Lambda Functions. After deploying the first application as AWS Lambda Function, you will understand how to pass arguments at run time and process as part of the application. When we use AWS Web Console to deploy the application as AWS Lambda Function using a blueprint, it uses the default handler. But when we start developing the applications, we might end up having multiple lambda functions as part of one deployed code base which means you need to define custom handlers in modules with custom names. After going through the details related to arguments, you will understand how to configure AWS Lambda Functions using custom handlers. Quite often we interact with other AWS Services from the applications deployed as AWS Lambda Functions. We will go through the details about interacting with AWS Services using AWS s3 as an example. After integrating AWS Lambda Function with AWS s3, we will go through the details about AWS IAM Roles to understand how the permissions are taken care of between different AWS Services. As we successfully integrate AWS Lambda with AWS s3, we will update the application to list the objects in s3. Quite often we need to customize the run-time behavior of the AWS Lambda Function or any application without changing the code. One of the ways to achieve it is using Environment Variables. We will understand how to use Environment Variables for AWS Lambda Functions. When we invoke AWS Lambda Function, it will be executed using managed resources of AWS. We will also go through the details about reviewing the resources such as memory, CPU, ephemeral storage, and timeout. Also, we will enhance the code which requires customizing the resources, and then validate whether the Lambda Function is running as expected or not. Even though we can use the editor provided by AWS Web Console to develop code for Python-based AWS Lambda Functions, it has its own limitations. After exploring the basics using AWS Web Console, we will go through the details about setting up a local environment for development. Once we have the local environment for the development of AWS Lambda Functions, we will develop a new AWS Lambda Function which depends on 3rd party libraries such as requests. We will then build the application as a zip file and deploy it as AWS Lambda Function. Also, we will validate if the AWS Lambda Function is running as expected or not. By the end of the course, you will understand how to get started with AWS Lambda Function using Python 3 run-time for free. However, if you would like to understand how to use AWS Lambda Functions for larger and more complex applications, feel free to sign up for our other courses on Udemy.",Free,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/ethical-hacking-for-beginners-beginner-to-advance/,Ethical Hacking for beginners: Beginner to Advance,"Learn how to become an elite ethical hacker and easily hack networks, computer systems, web apps","For those who have had no prior training or understanding in hacking or cybersecurity, this hands-on, practical course was designed just for them, with a focus on practical skills and hands-on experience. In this course, you will learn not only what black-hat hatters do and how they do it, but you will also learn how to hack systems like a pro and win the cat and mouse game by protecting systems like a professional security expert, which is the ultimate goal. Using a combination of hands-on experience and excellent theoretical instruction, we teach you from the fundamentals of ethical hacking all the way up to mastery, providing you with the skills you need not just to hack, but also to protect yourself from being hacked. While we recognize that theory is vital, we also recognize that it may be boring and uninspired at times. In order to facilitate learning, this course is filled with real-world examples that you can use. This hands-on approach begins at the beginning, when we will teach you about penetration testing and demonstrate how to install the necessary tools (for Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX) before diving right into hacking. Throughout the course, you will evaluate and attack a variety of systems, ranging from simple websites to complex networks, as well as hacking servers and client computers. You'll study more than just hacking tactics; you'll also learn how to perform effective penetration testing procedures. This method provides you with the basic understanding that you need not only to hack any given system, but also to secure it, with each module covering both sides of the coin as part of the learning process. The course is divided into six major sections: THE FIRST STEP IS TO LEARN THE ESSENTIALS OF BECOMING A HACKER. A thorough introduction to the fundamentals of networking systems, including how they communicate and function, is provided in this part, which is intended to equip you with the information and skills necessary to succeed in this course. THE ESSENTIALS OF NETWORKING: Networking might seem like a daunting subject, so don't be intimidated! We break down only the most critical aspects of networking that you need to know and teach you the foundations of networking that you need to be successful. ESTABLISHING A HACKING LABORATORY: You can't hack unless you have a lab! Setting up your own hacking lab on your laptop or desktop computer is easy when you follow our step-by-step instructions! PRINCIPLES OF LINUX + SCRIPTING: Hackers utilize Linux, which is an operating system that the typical person may not be familiar with. We will go through the fundamentals of Linux so that you will be able to find your way around the operating system during this course. We also cover a few of scripting languages that are absolutely necessary for every ethical hacker, and we teach you the fundamentals of each one through hands-on practice. HIDING YOUR IDENTITY ON THE INTERNET: If you plan on hacking into someone's computer through the internet, you'll want to understand how to remain anonymous. We will demonstrate the tools and tactics that you may employ to ensure that you stay anonymous and untraceable on the internet at all times. 2: BECOME FAMILIAR WITH NETWORK HACKING. This section explains how to test both wired and wireless systems in the same manner. During this course, you will learn how to move from not having any internet connectivity at all to having access and being able to launch attacks against other computers on the network. Assaults that take place before the target is connected, or even before the victim knows the password, are called pre-connection attacks. Learn how to identify and modify devices that are linked to a network, as well as how to obtain information about your intended target. ADVANCED: Learn how to leverage the knowledge you already have about your target to break the key and obtain the access password for a network. This section contains information on a variety of protocols, including WEP, WPA, and WPA2. POST-CONNECTION ATTACKS: With the use of a key, you may now take use of strong hacking techniques to obtain even more details. Learn how to monitor what people are doing on a network, insert code into web pages, and more on wired and wireless networks in this course. THREE: HOW TO OBTAIN ACCESS AND CONNECT WITH NETWORKS In this section, you will learn how to build on the knowledge you gained in Section One, by learning how to get complete control over and hack into any computer system you want. SERVER-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to gather information about your targeted system – including its operating system, open ports, and installed services – without requiring the user to participate. Then, using this knowledge, you may attack vulnerabilities and produce reports for your organization. CLIENT-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to hack systems that do not have any vulnerabilities by slipping into them with software updates or by downloading backdoor trojans from the internet. You'll also study the skill of social engineering, which is the practice of manipulating individuals into providing you with information. 4: HOW TO USE POST EXPLOITATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE As the title suggests, this part turns the emphasis to interfacing with compromised systems. Now that you have gotten access, you will learn how to take use of the systems you have discovered. ACCESS FILE SYSTEMS: All systems include a plethora of files, all of which you may now change using your access privileges. Learn how to gain access to these systems, as well as how to read, write, upload, and even run files on them. MAINTAIN ACCESS: Obtaining access to a system and its data is just half of the battle. The other half is maintaining access. Learn how to keep your access secure and to resist attempts to re-secure it so that you can continue to abuse a computer system. LEARN TO SPY ON YOUR TARGET: Discover how to record any keystrokes on a computer keyboard, activate a computer webcam, take screenshots, and even take complete control of the system in order to attack, hack, and get access to third-party networks and systems. The fifth step is to learn how to hack websites and web applications. If you read the previous part, you will have a better understanding of how to hack into websites and web apps using Kali Linux. Also covered will be the operation of web-based apps as well as how to identify and exploit security flaws that may exist inside them. Learn how to scan websites/web apps for vulnerabilities that may be used to your advantage. How to Infiltrate Web Applications Using Brute Force When it comes to online apps, SQL injection is a must. How to carry out Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks (CSRF) Exploiting File Inclusion Vulnerabilities: A Step-by-Step Guide Exploiting File Upload Vulnerabilities: A Step-by-Step Guide How to automate the assault on online apps by utilizing a number of different techniques How to prevent and secure websites and mobile applications on your own. 6: HOW TO MAKE MONEY AS A HACKER, LAND A JOB, AND BUILD A BRAND IN THE INDUSTRY In this part, you will learn how to generate money as an ethical hacker by employing a range of different strategies and techniques. You'll also learn how to establish your own brand and get your name out there as an Ethical Hacker so that employers and clients will come knocking on your door, eager to hire you for your services after you finish the course. Finally, you'll discover how to get started in a career in cybersecurity, including some insider suggestions on which certifications to pursue and how to acquire a position in this field of expertise. This includes the following: How to create your own personal brand as an ethical hacker from the ground up Learn how to instantly establish trust and authority as a hacker. Tips on how to effectively network and get people to talk about you Learn how to generate money online by utilizing a number of websites. How to begin working as a hacker on a contract basis. How to get started working as a hacking consultant. Learn how to get hired as a cybersecurity professional. This course is in-depth, and it will teach you about both sides of hacking. You will learn how to think and act like a hacker – and how to put that knowledge to use as a cybersecurity expert to safeguard your own networks and systems as well as those of your clients. With this ""cat and mouse"" method, your comprehensive understanding will provide additional depths and angles to your approach, indicating the avenues that you may follow to successfully neutralize any threat. In addition to the emphasis on practical examples that you can follow in real life with actual systems, you will benefit from the thrill of hands-on learning, which will enhance your learning experience. By learning firsthand what it takes to hack into any specific target system, you'll also come to understand that no two systems are alike and that all tactics may be tailored to fit the situation. This hands-on experience is a vital component of your education since it allows you to better understand what hackers are up to and how to defend against even the most sophisticated assaults. Any scenario or complexity of a hacking situation may be addressed in this course, which provides the basic knowledge you need to protect a network and begin your pursuit of a profession in an area that is becoming increasingly in demand as the world's reliance on technology rises.",Free,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning_x/,A deep understanding of deep learning (with Python intro),"Master deep learning in PyTorch using an experimental scientific approach, with lots of examples and practice problems.","Deep learning is increasingly dominating technology and has major implications for society. From self-driving cars to medical diagnoses, from face recognition to deep fakes, and from language translation to music generation, deep learning is spreading like wildfire throughout all areas of modern technology. But deep learning is not only about super-fancy, cutting-edge, highly sophisticated applications. Deep learning is increasingly becoming a standard tool in machine-learning, data science, and statistics. Deep learning is used by small startups for data mining and dimension reduction, by governments for detecting tax evasion, and by scientists for detecting patterns in their research data. Deep learning is now used in most areas of technology, business, and entertainment. And it's becoming more important every year. How does deep learning work? Deep learning is built on a really simple principle: Take a super-simple algorithm (weighted sum and nonlinearity), and repeat it many many times until the result is an incredibly complex and sophisticated learned representation of the data. Is it really that simple?  mmm OK, it's actually a tiny bit more complicated than that ;)   but that's the core idea, and everything else -- literally everything else in deep learning -- is just clever ways of putting together these fundamental building blocks. That doesn't mean the deep neural networks are trivial to understand: there are important architectural differences between feedforward networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks. Given the diversity of deep learning model designs, parameters, and applications, you can only learn deep learning -- I mean,  really  learn deep learning, not just have superficial knowledge from a youtube video -- by having an experienced teacher guide you through the math, implementations, and reasoning. And of course, you need to have lots of hands-on examples and practice problems to work through. Deep learning is basically just applied math, and, as everyone knows, math is not a spectator sport! What is this course all about? Simply put: The purpose of this course is to provide a deep-dive into deep learning. You will gain flexible, fundamental, and lasting expertise on deep learning. You will have a deep understanding of the fundamental concepts in deep learning, so that you will be able to learn new topics and trends that emerge in the future. Please note: This is not a course for someone who wants a quick overview of deep learning with a few solved examples. Instead, this course is designed for people who really want to understand how and why deep learning works; when and how to select metaparameters like optimizers, normalizations, and learning rates; how to evaluate the performance of deep neural network models; and how to modify and adapt existing models to solve new problems. You can learn everything about deep learning in this course. In this course, you will learn  Theory : Why are deep learning models built the way they are?  Math : What are the formulas and mechanisms of deep learning? Implementation : How are deep learning models actually constructed in Python (using the PyTorch library)? Intuition : Why is this or that metaparameter the right choice? How to interpret the effects of regularization? etc. Python : If you're completely new to Python, go through the 8+ hour coding tutorial appendix. If you're already a knowledgeable coder, then you'll still learn some new tricks and code optimizations. Google-colab : Colab is an amazing online tool for running Python code, simulations, and heavy computations using Google's cloud services. No need to install anything on your computer. Unique aspects of this course Clear and comprehensible explanations of concepts in deep learning, including transfer learning, generative modeling, convolutional neural networks, feedforward networks, generative adversarial networks (GAN), and more. Several distinct explanations of the same ideas, which is a proven technique for learning. Visualizations using graphs, numbers, and spaces that provide intuition of artificial neural networks. LOTS  of exercises, projects, code-challenges, suggestions for exploring the code. You learn best by doing it yourself! Active Q&A forum where you can ask questions, get feedback, and contribute to the community. 8+ hour Python tutorial. That means you don't need to master Python before enrolling in this course.

https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-options-trading-courses/,Options Trading Basics (3-Course Bundle),"A bundle combines 1)Intro to Call and Put Options 2) Time decay, Implied Volatility, Greeks 3) Call and Puts Live trades","THREE COURSE BUNDLE - 10+ HOURS   	 The first 3 Options Trading Strategies courses are combined to create this bundle. To master the basics of Options, you really need all three courses.    	A brief synopsis of the options trading strategies courses are provided below. LEARN CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS, OPTIONS FOUNDATION - TIME DECAY, IMPLIED VOLATILITY, OPTION GREEKS  BUYING CALL OPTIONS AND PUT OPTIONS - LIVE TRADES     	  SECTION I -  Call Options      	Most people learning Options for the first time face too much jargon and complex language. This options trading strategies course use real-world examples (buying a house) to explain how a Call Option (Section 1) works in real life. This example should make it absolutely clear what a Call Option is in step-by-step details.     	 SECTION II - Put Options.       	The Put Option is the ultimate ""protector"" of your portfolio, and in this course you can learn how Put Options work. It is the exact opposite of a Call Option. Put Options increase in value when the value of a stock or index drops in price. We define what a Put Option, and just like we did in the Call Option, we consider a real-world example of a Put Option.     	 SECTION III - Stock and Options combo strategies      	In this section, three creative strategies are outlined for Stock investors to combine Options into their portfolio strategies.     	·  Use Options to buy Stock at prices that are far lower than what the stock is currently trading for     	·  Use Options to sell Stock at prices that are far higher than what it is currently trading for     	·  Use Options to hedge a Stock position that you already own     	  SECTION IV - TIME DECAY      	Time decay is a pivotal component of Options strategies. In fact, time decay alone is responsible for the majority of advanced option strategies. In this part of the options trading strategies course, we are going to study the concept in detail. Options are ""wasting"" assets, and they lose value every day. The buyer gets hurt from time decay and the seller benefits from it. And time decay becomes more exponential as we approach expiry of an Option. It is also the great equalizer between the profiles of a buyer and seller of Options. Time decay is the great equalizer in the risk / reward profiles of buyers and sellers of Options. Several intermediate and advanced strategies are based on selling premium (option sellers) and these positions make a profit due to time decay in the value of these options over a period of time.     	  SECTION V - IMPLIED VOLATILITY       	Implied Volatility is the ""wildcard"" in Option prices. Ignore it, and you will pay a price. In fact, it's so important we have at least four different varieties - Volatility, Implied Volatility, Historical Volatility, and Future or Expected Volatility. We use the real-world examples to explain the concept of Volatility in simple terms. Then we study how Volatility is quantified in Stocks and Options. And how Volatility finds a back-door to embed itself into Option prices. Implied Volatility considerations are critical when choosing between a buyer and seller profile. We break this complex topic down into simple terms and show you an example of NFLX and CAT options that should make it absolutely clear what this is all about.     	 SECTION VI - OPTION GREEKS, DELTA, GAMMA, VEGA, THETA      	If you're the pilot of an aircraft, the Greeks are your instrument panel. If you don't manage your instrument panel properly, well...you get the picture. Understanding the Greeks are absolutely critical to every Option position. We break this course into easy to understand chapters for all the four Greeks - Delta, the king of all Greeks. Gamma - the silent operator. Theta - every Option seller's dream. And Vega - Watch out for this one.. Most beginners to Options tend to ignore the Greeks. Master the Greeks and you'll shave off months of learning curve. Not to mention, you can then fly your aircraft on ""auto-pilot"" (with help from the Greeks).     	 SECTION VII - OPTIONS MARKET STRUCTURE      	The Options market has a number of terms that we need to be aware of. Starting with terminology differences like ""Long"" and ""Short"", we look at all the details that go into the Options market. We explain the important processes like Exercise and Assignment, as well as things like Expiry series, Bid-Ask spreads, Brokerage and transaction costs and various other details. What is Open Interest and why is it important, and what is the role of a Market Maker. We study the different Order types and which ones are important for the average investor, and which ones make sense in different situations. We also discuss Regulation T Margin as it applies to Options as well as Portfolio margin.     	 SECTION VIII - BUY A CALL OPTION (CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL)      	Buying a Call Option is the most basic of all the Option strategies and is the most efficient strategy to optimize a bullish outlook on a stock. In this options trading strategies course, we take the example of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and show how the trade played out. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and ""moneyness"" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. This is a real trade and over 15 days, and we navigate the trade to its exit point.     	 SECTION IX - BUYING A PUT OPTION (FXE EURO ETF)      	Buying a Put Option serves two purposes - exploit a bearish move in the stock or be the ultimate protector of your stock. In this part of the course, we take the example of the Euro ETF (FXE) and show how the trade played out in about 25 days time. We analyze the rationale behind entering the trade, the risk/reward profile, chart analysis and point of entry, choice of expiry and ""moneyness"" of the Option, time decay considerations, margin requirements, profit expectations, exit criteria, Greek analysis, its Profit and Loss profile and various other considerations. We provide a 360-degree analysis before trade entry. We show you how to ""let your winners run"" in a controlled manner.     	 SECTION X - STRATEGY AND OPTIMIZATION       	The Option strategy optimization course brings all the 4 Options strategies together. The 4 strategies are comprised of 2 bullish and 2 bearish strategies, but how and when should we choose a particular strategy over the other. We create a helpful ""4 strategies box"" to distinguish and connect one strategy to the other. Most importantly, what are all the considerations before we choose a strategy. Our choice of strategy depends not only on what the stock is currently doing, but also on various market externalities as well as a few key Option metrics like Implied Volatility. This course also provides a sneak peek into advanced Option topics like the VIX (Fear index""), trade simulation as well as trade adjustment parameters.     	 SECTION XII - SINGLE OPTION ADJUSTMENTS       	This options trading strategies course studies the need for Option adjustments, and why adjustments are as critical to the success of your position as good entry or analysis. We consider all the four basic strategies - the Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, and the Short Put and look at various adjustments to these positions if they get into trouble. Every investor has a ""pain point"" - this is the point at which they adjust their position. Applying a rigorous approach to this pain point enables investors to control risk while maximizing the opportunity to profit. The course also discusses various details like early adjustments, over-adjusting and adjusting profitable trades as well as the importance of the investor's outlook for the stock when considering adjustments.     	 This bundle consists of  Courses       	 Course I - Introduction to Options  - Learn about Call Options and Put Options is a detailed step-by-step explanation of Options, Call Options and Put Options with theory and practical application with Apple (AAPL) Options     	 Course II - Options Foundation - Time Decay, Implied Volatility and Options Greeks  will complete your theoretical understanding of Options.     	 Course III is Options strategies for Beginners - Buying Call Options and Put Options  where we actually put live trades and manage them to their exit points.

Stress that's left unchecked can contribute to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes.

https://www.udemy.com/course/building-microservices-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud/,[NEW] Building Microservices with Spring Boot & Spring Cloud,"Learn to Build Microservices using Spring Boot 3, Spring Cloud, React, Kafka, RabbitMQ, REST API, Docker & IntelliJ IDEA","In this course, you will learn to build Microservices using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, React, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, and REST API (REST Web Services). Important Note:  This course supports the latest  Spring Boot 3  and  Spring Cloud 2022.0.0 . Microservices: A Microservice is a service built around a specific business capability that can be independently deployed. So, to build large enterprise applications we can identify the sub-domains of our main business domain and build each sub-domain as a MicroService using Domain Driven Design (DDD) techniques. But in the end, we need to make all these microservices work together to serve the end user as if it is a single application. Why Spring boot and Spring cloud are good choices for MicroServices? Spring Boot  is the most popular and widely used Java framework for building Microservices. These days many organizations prefer to deploy their applications in a Cloud environment instead of taking all the headaches of maintaining a data center themselves. But we need to take good care of the various aspects to make our applications Cloud Native. There comes the beauty of Spring Cloud. Spring Cloud  is essentially an implementation of various design patterns to be followed while building Cloud Native applications. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can simply take advantage of various Spring Cloud modules and focus on our main business problem than worrying about infrastructural concerns. What you'll learn Build RESTful web services using Spring Boot - Learn Important Spring MVC Annotations Build CRUD REST APIs using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Database Building Spring Boot Microservices in IntelliJ IDEA Microservices Communication using RestTemplate, WebClient, and  Spring Cloud OpenFeign Create Service Registry and Discovery using  Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka Load balancing with Eureka server and Open Feign using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer Create API Gateway using  Spring Cloud Gateway Centralized Configurations using  Spring Cloud Config Server Auto Refresh Config Changes using  Spring Cloud Bus Distributed Tracing with  Spring Cloud Sleuth  and Zipkin Resilience4J:  Circuit Breaker , Retry, and RateLimiter Patterns Adding Step-by-step new Microservice to Existing Project Create React Frontend Microservice and Integrate with Backend Microservices Learn How to Migrate Existing Projects to the Latest Version Learn How to Generate REST API Documentation Dockering Spring Boot Application Step by Step Dockering Spring Boot MySQL CRUD Application Step by Step Docker Compose for Dockering Spring Boot MySQL CRUD Application Step by Step Event-Driven Microservices using Spring boot and Kafka Learn how to use RabbitMQ in the Spring boot app. Learn how to use Kafka in the Spring boot app. Kafka Spring Boot - Real-World Wikimedia Project Development Event-Driven Microservices using Spring boot and RabbitMQ Tools and technologies used: 1.

Becoming an effective and efficient artist is not something that happens overnight, but putting these lessons and strategies into daily practice can help you earn and become successful in the music industry. Every lesson on this course will be useful, and will surely change your life. You will learn the step by step blueprint these record labels are using to break artist into the music industry Each module will cover the following :  1. Introduction of nard2hard and the Blueprint 2. Phrase 1 (THE SET UP) 3. Phrase 2 (THE INVESTMENT) 4. Phrase 3 (THE SAUCE) Going At It Alone Is Never Going To Work Unless you WIN THE LOTTERY, GET GRANTED 3 WISHES, MANIFEST A MIRACLE, you’ll always struggle with succeeding in the music industry. It’s not something you can type into Google… It’s not something that you can learn from scratch unless you have millions of dollars in the bank, and years of your life to waste. And it’s not something that comes easily to most. That’s why you need a simple, step-by-step guide to show you EXACTLY how to achieve everything you want - without trial and error and expensive mistakes. They Don't Teach This in School Trust me! I searched long and wide for schools, classes on and offline and The blueprints that I have inside this course can not be found anywhere else. This knowledge was accumulated from years of trial and error. You Only Have Two Options OPTION 1: FORGET THIS EXISTS You can act as if this course doesn’t exist, and go back to suffering in silence, living a life you’re truly unsatisfied with. You won’t get access to this simple step by step blueprint that will help you generate up to 7 figures a year doing something that you love so it dont feel like work. And you definitely won’t get to live the dream life you always hoped for You’ll simply carry on down the same path, leaving your future (and paycheck) in the hands of another. But I know that’s not what you want. And I know that’s not why you’re still here, on this page, looking for a way to change your entire life. That’s why there’s a SECOND, much more appealing option! OPTION 2: COMMIT, TAKE ACTION & CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER Your second option gives you the BEST possible chance at success and enables you to skip all of the long-winded, confusing, time-consuming risks you can’t afford to take. Your second option is, yep - you guessed it, to take me up on my offer of getting the ""How To Make It In The Music Industry BluePrint"" today.

That means, if you WANT to achieve success in the music industry, without any music connections, prior knowledge or clout you need to act fast, and you need to act now. Most people will NEVER come across a chance like this… And here you are, considering giving it all up due to fear of the unknown, and what “someone once said”. This course isn’t based on predictions, what I think might work, or what someone said in a forum online… This is based on my REAL experience and very REAL results. I’ve deep-dived into every single step that I’ve taken to get to where I am today, and I’m basically handing you my ENTIRE life’s work for a small one-time payment.

I decided to integrate “I Am” affirmations with my personal clearing to give me a deeper connection to my internal experience. I received such profound insights and results that I began teaching the clearing to clients and students. I was interested in seeing whether my personalized concept would have the same positive effect for others as it had for me. People began releasing fear simply by recognizing how they felt in specific parts of their body. They also began to realize how negative self talk had been impacting their reality. As you continue to practice, you will notice your days becoming more inspired and effortless once you tap into the unseen power of your own energy. When things aren’t working in a certain area of your life, you will learn how to connect the issue to one or more chakras, do a clearing and make the correction energetically. Use it as a tool to heal anxiety and fear in your body and mind, and you will find it shifting your physical reality as well.",Free,en_US

You need to learn BGP for your exam! Get prepared.,"The Cisco CCNA exam now requires that you know BGP. This is the exam topic Cisco have listed for the exam: ""Configure and verify single-homed branch connectivity using eBGP IPv4 (limited to peering and route advertisement using Network command only)""   In this course you will learn the basics of BGP as well as investigate multiple troubleshooting scenarios to help you prepare for the exam.   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. The protocol is often classified as a path vector protocol but is sometimes also classed as a distance-vector routing protocol. The Border Gateway Protocol makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator and is involved in making core routing decisions.   BGP may be used for routing within an autonomous system. In this application it is referred to as Interior Border Gateway Protocol, Internal BGP, or iBGP. In contrast, the Internet application of the protocol may be referred to as Exterior Border Gateway Protocol, External BGP, or eBGP.   BGP4 is standard for Internet routing, required of most Internet service providers (ISPs) to establish routing between one another. Very large private IP networks use BGP internally. An example is the joining of a number of large Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) networks, when OSPF by itself does not scale to the size required. Another reason to use BGP is multihoming a network for better redundancy, either to multiple access points of a single ISP or to multiple ISPs.",Free,en_US

This course will level up your data skills to help you grow your career in Data Science, Machine Learning, Finance, Web Development, or any tech-adjacent field.

The topics in this courses are extremely visual and immediate, which makes them a joy to teach (and hopefully for you to learn).   If you have even a passing interest in these topics, you'll likely enjoy the course and tear through it quickly.  This stuff might seem intimidating, but it's actually really approachable and fun!

The system is a  Microservice-based architecture , and along the way, we'll look at design decisions and trade-offs you need to make when managing these complex systems. Note the course isn't about how to design Microservices (although we'll certainly be talking about that); the development work is done and we need to get the system running on a production cluster. We'll also discover that the developers have made some bad mistakes in their code, by analyzing the run time performance of the cluster! You can do the first part of the course on your local development computer (PC/Mac/Laptop). The second part (from Chapter 13 onwards) moves to the cloud. You'll use a real  AWS  account, and we go-ahead to set up monitoring with the  ELK/Elastic Stack  and monitor with  Prometheus and Grafana . The course now supports  EKS,  the AWS  Elastic Kubernetes Service,  but we also show how to use the alternative system, called  Kops . The pros and cons of each are explained in detail. I've designed this course for a wide audience - whether you're a DevOps engineer, a developer, or if you're quite new to the whole field, I'll explain everything along the way. Just some basic knowledge of working with computers, and maybe a bit of command-line experience will suffice. You will need an AWS account for a part of the course if you want to work on the system yourself . If you're new to AWS then don't worry, I've got you covered -but Amazon will charge you for running the system (as with all/most cloud providers). Expect to pay no more than around 10USD for this (this is a safe overestimate), but you are expected to manage this spend yourself and you must delete your Kubernetes cluster at the end of your session. Don't let that put you off, it's a great investment. You can absolutely just watch the AWS videos if you'd prefer not to incur these costs - you will still learn plenty! As always, I'm here to answer questions and I aim to respond within 48 hours. Good luck!",€34.99,en_US

https://www.udemy.com/course/5-present-breaths/,Meditation For Being In Present Moment - 5 Present Breaths,Powerful Meditation for Developing Inner Stability and Peace - Develop Insight 20min a day,"The 5 Present Breaths Meditation was created to guide you to develop and experience a state of mind known as  The Present Moment—The state of Stillness . Why do we want to be in the Present Moment? When the mind is in the  Present Moment , it is in a state of  Stillness  and  Awareness . This is a powerful state of mind from which insight and enlightenment is naturally born. If one wishes for greater happiness in their life, one must address the causes of their unhappiness. But to address Them, one must first become aware of them. By learning to be Still and be Present in every moment, one will naturally realize the causes of their Unstillness and Unpresentness. The Present Moment Is A Happy moment Through the practice of the 5 Present Breaths, the mind will be dragged into the Present moment deeper and deeper with each breath. And as we begin to experience the peacefulness of the present moment, one will begin to encounter the wandering thoughts surfacing, pulling one away from the Present moment. So the 5 Present Breaths is not only a practice for one to experience the joy of being in the Present Moment, but it is also a practice for one to uncover their wandering thoughts. Realize that the deeper we can be aware of our wandering thoughts, the deeper we will be able to release them and experience deeper peace. Ultimately and naturally, we will also realize the deeper causes of our wandering thoughts. The more you meditate, the more you will know yourself! ======Some Testimonials===== ""This course was about basic medication at its finest.

Are you getting often sick? How is your immunity? Are you afraid of viruses and bacteria? In these days where our  immune systems are compromised  by global pollution, bad diet and addictions, it is essential to harmonize all the different parts of our body and to restore a healthy, dynamic and coherent flow of life within us. Immunity=I’m Unity. It is all about bringing back healthy communication, coherence and power in our different body systems. Our  organs are the foundations of our health .

In this class, we will explore more than  80   DNA codes to purify and activate all our organs, meridians and marvelous vessels . These DNA codes are phonic triggers, like sounds that you need to repeat aloud 3 times to activate some dormant energetic systems in your DNA that will purify and/or activate a specific part of your body. Here are the codes we will discover together: Our organs/body parts: Eyes, Ears, Mouth, Gums, Tongue, Nose, Larynx, Brain, Lungs, heart, Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Bladder, Skin, Kidneys, Small Intestine, long Intestine and Gallbladder.

A  meditation with Illahi Noor,  the golden Ray energy will help us to reharmonize the communication between all our cells. You will be as well introduced to testing to be able to determine the purity and vitality of each of your organs-meridians. And you will be able to track the improvements. Some  general tips of  herbal remedies, detox techniques and breathwork will be shared as well. If you have already played with DNA codes from my other classes, then you know how efficient they can be. And if it is your fist class with these codes, then simply trust: your body has all the answers, all the power to restore health, harmony and joy.

https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-for-amazon-fba-sellers-maximize-profits-using-data/,Amazon Seller Training Course #1 • Excel Analytics (Basics),"Understand your statistics, manipulate any report data, optimize your portfolio and boost your Amazon business!","Are you an  Amazon FBA seller? Are you looking to  make more sales, improve profits  or just  make better, data-driven decisions? And final question: Do you have  little Excel or spreadsheet experience , but want to learn how to use them for Amazon within  just 2h ? Then this course is for you! In this course, you will learn the following: • The  14 most-used formulas  you NEED to know to process 90% of Amazon product sales & product info data • How to turn a raw (and ugly) Amazon business report into an  understandable  and  presentable table • How to  bundle different products' data together  to get an overview of their performance as a single category  (Which category sells best? What are the top sellers for which category? Should you drop a category of products?)    • How to  easily connect/import data from one sheet to another  (e.g. link ALL your costs from start to finish (manufacturer costs, shipping costs, FBA fees, etc.) - An absolute requirement for any serious Amazon business!)  •  Analyze  and  estimate profits, margins, breakdown costs  on a  per-unit basis  (How much are you REALLY making for each unit sold? Which products are worth the time invested? What's your real margin? Which products should you focus your optimization efforts on first?)  •  Create your  own custom reports  and  personalized views  to display any data the way you (or your clients) want to see it  •  Custom filters and criteria  so you can  access exactly the kind of data you want   (Want to know which of your products in category A are costing you the most money? Easy!)   •  Charts and graphs  to represent the data that you want in a  visually appealing way  - no need for expensive third-party tools!  (e.g. Revenue over time per SKU, Cost-per-unit breakdown, etc.)  --------------------------------- So you’re an Amazon seller and you want to use data analytics to increase your sales and profits. If that’s the case, and you aren’t very comfortable with the Excel-format reports that Amazon gives you, then you’re exactly in the right place! Data analytics has never been more important than in the last few years – and that’s true for any business, including any business that sells on Amazon. Any top seller needs to be able to analyze and understand their data if they want to increase their sales and profits. Sure, there are some tools out there that can help you with that – but the problem is, you can only get the information that they give. Maybe you need to get some specific data from some special reports, or maybe you want to be able to create your own dashboard, tracking systems and charts, without having to pay someone else a large sum of money every month to do it for you. Let’s say you want to compare your latest weekly sales from Amazon’s business report with a report from your manufacturer – for instance, the future purchase price for each product you’re selling. Most top tools out there won’t give you that. Or, you want to know if you’re still going to make more than a 10% profit margin if you raise the price of all your red Christmas decoration products by 14%, or maybe you also want to know if you’re likely to make more than… $3000 a month if your manufacturers raise the purchase price of …three of these products by…5%? Any successful business needs to work with data. Most tools give you the basics, but basics isn’t enough to be a top seller on Amazon nowadays – if you want to raise your revenues and profits beyond what’s average, you need to be able to work your own data. In this course, you will learn how to process 90% of any Amazon-related report in less than 2 hours. Using 14 core formulas, you will be able to get all the information that you really need from any report – sales reports, advertising reports, stock reports, shipment reports… and most importantly, you can combine them with any other kind of report and create your own custom reports, where you can see everything that YOU want to see. And yes, even if you’re a complete beginner with Excel, this course is for you. Okay, you get the point, I’ll stop there – join the course now and learn how you can become your own Amazon Data Analyst in just 2 hours! Don’t worry – if somehow the course isn’t to your liking, you can always get your full money back, that’s Udemy policy – there’s zero risk for you, so just grab a cup of tea or coffee, get comfortable and let’s get going! ---------------------------- FAQ: Do I need to purchase anything for this course? You only need a version of Microsoft Excel (2016 and above) or create an account for Google Sheets (free). While the exact steps might be different, it is understanding the principles that's important - so don't worry, you do not need to spend a single cent! Do I need any prior knowledge or experience? As this course is designed for Amazon sellers, the only requirement here is for you to be somewhat familiar with Amazon Seller Central to download the reports. If you do not know what or where these reports are, you can easily check out a free tutorial on Udemy or another platform (e.g. Youtube) and then come back to the course afterwards. This should take no longer than 30 minutes at most.",Free,en_US

On the other hand, all that a person who intends to study the Vedas needs is an open heart, mind and soul. The journey through the Vedas is spiritual and intellectual, which takes a seeker through the different stages, right from the early learning stages to that of being a Self-realised person. The ultimate goal is Self-realisation. However, due to various reasons, in the name of religion, devotion, and spirituality, different kinds of practices have emerged over a large period of time. These have succeeded in leading seekers far away from the Vedas, of which, the Upanishads are the summit and contain the core non-dualistic philosophy. It is quite natural for people who decide to study the Vedas and Vedanta to consider taking lessons from great teachers. However, in the busy lives that people lead these days, finding the time or even the right teacher becomes a major stumbling block. This programme is aimed at enabling seekers to acquire an overview of the non-dualistic philosophy, the Vedic and Upanishadic 'god concept,' the greatness and advanced way of thinking of ancient sages of the Vedic and later periods, and to take the first step towards comprehending their own innate Divinity.

https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-clean-architecture-ddd-saga-outbox-kafka-kubernetes/,"Microservices: Clean Architecture, DDD, SAGA, Outbox & Kafka","Learn Spring boot microservices with Clean & Hexagonal architectures, DDD, SAGA, Outbox, CQRS, Kafka, Kubernetes & GKE","Hi there! My name is Ali Gelenler. I'm here to help you learn microservices architecture while applying Clean and Hexagonal Architectures and using Domain Driven Design. In this course, you will focus on architectural aspects of microservices architecture and use Clean & Hexagonal Architecture principles while developing each service. In the implementation of the domain layer you will also apply Domain Driven Design principles. You can always use the latest versions for spring boot, and other dependencies in this course. I will be constantly updating the dependency version in the last section's lectures. You may check that to see the required code and configuration changes for updated versions. Also if you would like to use subtitles during the course, you can turn on the captions on videos as all lectures are updated with hand-written subtitles by choosing among over 20 different languages. I suggest using subtitles to make it easier to follow the lectures. Scott Knox:  ""As a working professional, I can already tell this is the holy grail of understanding modern architectures. If your company is struggling to grasp certain concepts, this course will help you help them. Thanks Ali for the excellent explanations!"" You will implement SAGA, Outbox and CQRS patterns using the 4 Spring boot Java microservices that you will develop using Clean and Hexagonal architecture principles.  Nick Goupinets:  ""Great course - gives a deep-dive into microservice development experience with Spring Boot. As an added bonus shows how to deploy it with Kubernetes. At times it felt too detailed, sort of making it hard to see the forest behind the trees. Also Hex. architecture resulted in what looked like an over-engineered overall solution. With that said, Ali did a fantastic job explaining all of the design decisions with clear architecture diagrams that offset that complexity!"" You will also learn and use Apache Kafka as the event store, and use events to communicate between services, and to implement the architectural patterns. Nischal Jadhav:  ""If u are looking to become an high level developer or an architect, then this is the best course.!"" The concepts that you will be learning and implementing are: Spring boot microservices Clean Architecture Hexagonal Architecture Domain Driven Design Event-driven services using Apache Kafka SAGA Architecture Pattern Outbox Architecture Pattern CQRS Architecture Pattern Kubernetes on local using Docker desktop Kubernetes on Google Cloud using Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE) Ali Aminian:  ""I really like this course. Thanks Ali for complete description and professional coding. I really enjoy to participate this course."" To communicate with the data stores in microservices you will use Spring Data JPA for PostgreSQL, and Spring Kafka for Kafka. You will be following a hands-on approach and  developing a project from scratch. You will have 4 microservices that communicate using events with Kafka as the event store. r j:  ""This is an amazing course. An architect from my team recommended this to me and he's implemented something similar but bigger in our company, the biggest retailer on the planet."" You will also have multiple choice quizzes in each section to check your progress throughout the course.  Arindam Majumdar:  ""This course helped me immensely to understand the Domain Driven Design approach on Microservices. Its so far the best hands on course I have come across in Udemy so far. Many thanks to Ali. Great job!! :)"" At the end of the course you will understand how to run an event-driven microservices architecture with Clean and Hexagonal Architecture principles and with Domain Driven Design concepts. You will use Spring boot and Java to develop the microservices. You will also learn implementing architectural microservices patterns such as SAGA, Outbox and CQRS. In the end you will be able to deploy your application to Kubernetes on Google Cloud using Google Kubernetes Engine. Anurag tiwari:  ""Just started the course but i can already tell that this a good one Ali explains all the concepts like out box ,saga pattern so well. I would highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to take their knowledge about microservices to the next level using different patterns like hexagonal ,saga pattern. I would also recommend this course for beginners as youll learn a ton of stuff regarding microservices and patterns to create agile services as this course is very hands on"" I have followed the same clean & hexagonal architectures and domain driven design principles in the implementation of each microservice. If you feel like you want to skip some repeating parts, you may download the source code that I provide in the first lecture of each section starting from section-3. You can then use the provided source code to continue with the section. Narendra Kumar A:  ""Its awesome course, I have ever come across in Udemy explaining the DDD, Clean architecture and usage of patterns concepts so cleanly."" For more detailed information on the progress of this course, you can check the introductory video and free lessons, and if you decide to enroll in this course, you are always welcome to ask and discuss the concepts and implementation details on Q/A and messages sections. I will guide you from start to finish to help you successfully complete the course and gain as much knowledge and experience as possible from this course. Jason:  ""This course is one of the best I ever had. There are many microsevices courses on Udemy, and most of them are like something that manufactured in the same factory. They all used the same framework and followed the same steps to teach microservices. They never talked about the important concepts behind the microservice. I felt like they just wanted to show off the latest version of frameworks and finish the long courses with them quickly and get paid. The impression after I watched first this lesson was amazing. He actually starts the project with the bare bone java plain object. It was like I'm flying with feather, not fully armed with numerous buzzword frameworks. It might be frustrated at first if you are really new to microservices and never heard of concepts like DDD before. But I'm pretty sure this is one of the courses that make you a ""better"" developer.""",€94.99,en_US
